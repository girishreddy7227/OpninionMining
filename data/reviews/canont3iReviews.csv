I sent the camera back to Canon under warranty to have them repair the issue.I got an email back from Canon a week later stating it was not covered under warranty because my camera showed signs of 'customer tampering' and that internal screws had been stripped and replaced. This made me furious as I have NEVER opened up my camera or would not even know how to. I have NEVER dropped it and have babied it the whole time.I called Canon customer service and after arguing with them for 30mins they finally agreed to repair the camera for free(I appreciated this). However they still were in denial that they had sent me a defective camera initially which is disappointing and frustrating.I believe there are two possible explanations:1. Canon has significant quality control issues in their refurbished products and they could not detect the tampered screws.2. Canon's warranty center has logistics issues and confused my camera with another warranty camera that had tampered screws.Either way the result is an honest customer not having their warranty honored and falsely accused of 'tampering'.Bottom Line: GOOD CAMERA BUT DON'T BANK ON THE QUALITY CONTROL OR WARRANTY!"

I freaked out (internally not visibly), but let it go and missed the shots :(This camera is touchy and apparently the lens focus can get stuck (it seems to be a common, unaddressed problem with this camera) when it's on auto.  When that happens, it will not work in auto, period.  When that happens, you have to pull on the lens focus ring, until you hear a click and then it will work again.  And also - if it doesn't work on auto, immediately turn it to manual and it will work (most likely, as it did for me and many other people who own this camera).  I found this out half by accident (the manual part, which I figured out halfway through my daughters wedding), and the other half from finding one awesome individual who had posted the fix for this, and left it online for 2 years.  I am posting this on amazon because I do not want this to happen to Anyone else (and I look at amazon reviews and take them into consideration, before I purchase an expensive item, myself, so I would guess other people do too).  Maybe all dslr cameras are touchy, I don't know, this is my first one.  But I wanted to try and make sure no one else missed a pivotal moment, if the camera suddenly stopped working.  I still love the camera, but I can only give it 3 stars due to the info I am passing on here is Not in the instruction manual(and it should be).I contacted canon about this issue and was told they did not have time to address every trouble shooting issue this camera could have.  Even common issues, apparently.  I was very disappointed in their customer service.  And was even told - gee, look at all our great reviews on amazon.  Which makes me wonder how many of the great reviews were written by people working for canon.  And while I give the camera 3 stars, I give the company that makes this camera, zero stars."

It is nice to be able to turn the screen so I can hold the camera high or low and still be able to see what I am shooting, or to turn the screen completely around so it is protected by the camera body.It has been replaced by the T4i (the video mode is now accessed with the on/off lever and not the wheel), and the T5i (the video screen is now a touch screen)If you want to start doing digital, I highly recommend picking one up (and since it is a couple of generations old, you should be able to score a good deal)"

This camera has impressed me even more, even though it is supposedly a step up. The resolution of the LCD screen is astounding and, as always, Canon is able to produce the most crisp and vivid colors that impress even with the kit lens.Once one begins to familiarize themselves with the Manual setting and adjusting the ISO, aperture, and shutter, there is no limit to the quality of artistic photography. As far as video, this camera is not really ideal for recording children or sports events, but more short clips that change focus or take on a more movie-like approach.Overall, I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who is looking to step up from the basic DSLR camera."

Instead you're reduced to using menus. Don't know about you but I want to be able to quickly switch settings with a flick of a switch or turn of a dial... you know like a real DSLR camera. This severely hurts this camera's use for live practical applications (action, event, wedding). This would be an absolute deal killer for me but I got the camera for free. Otherwise I would've returned it. You shouldn't need manual to understand the basics of a camera in my opinion. It takes a while to get used to... and it's a style of camera I'd rather NOT get used to. Unintuitive. Seriously do not understand CANON's thinking. If I didn't shoot video for a living and if I had the money I would jump ship and stay with Nikon.- This camera is basically a poor man's studio camera that fronts as a easy-to use DSLR. It's not.- Megapixel count is slightly bloated. Again, you only need to extra pixel for editing. I also own a Nikin D90 with only 12M. Similar quality. Way better function!

I have had the T3i/600D for about 4 months now.I am extremely satisfied with my purchase. Note that this is not the latest model. There is very little difference between this model and other later or more expensive 'crop frame' (APS-C sensor) SLRs from Canon or other makers. Don't get caught up in the spec wars. Concentrate on the basics and in improving your skills, not on the latest gadgetry or features. Picture quality is excellent, once you know what you are doing and practice. Even the 18-55 mm kit IS II lens is decent, especially if you work with it in its sweet spot-- medium to wide angle, and f-stops in the 8-11 range. Make sure you get the latest model (II) of this lens. I also recommend getting the inexpensive but very good value Canon 50 mm 1.8 lens as well.The build quality is excellent, and the camera is intuitive to operate. Controls are convenient. The built-in TTL flash is good for quick convenient snapshots (GN=13), but if you do serious low light photography you'll want an external flash that you can bounce. Get one of the off-brand, manual flashes (such as Yongnuo), and you'll enhance your photography as well as save a lot of money compared to an original Canon flash.  I also highly recommend installing the free, open source 'Magic Lantern' software to enhance the camera's capabilities. Particularly useful in this software is the 'intervalometer' (timer) feature, HDR bracketing, and the ability to control the bit rate of the video recording.You typically get about 400-450 shots on a battery charge. The camera comes with a CD containing good software for processing RAW files, editing jpgs, transferring files and controlling the camera via the computer. The included printed manual is thorough and well written, and covers a lot of photography basics in a very readable way.This camera is an excellent value and I highly recommend it to people wishing to step up from a point and shoot camera to something more serious. This camera can produce professional looking photographs.I would also recommend buying a moderately priced tripod (the very cheap ones will break after a few uses so don't get tempted, especially with your $600+ camera perched on it). A tripod significantly enhances your options in various situations (low light or landscape)  and will improve your photographs immeasurably.The only serious limitation this camera has is the relatively slow continuous shooting rate. It is rates at 3+/sec, but in reality it is less if your are shooting in low light or in RAW mode. This could be a problem if you like to shoot sporting events or other action shots."

My previous digital camera was a point and shoot style. We had been debating taking the plunge and purchasing a DSLR camera. Here are some of the highlights.Value: If you keep an eye out you may be able to purchase the camera in conjunction with an extra lens rebate deal. This is how I got the camera and the total package was a bargain.User Friendly: A DSLR can be intimidating with all of the buttons and options available. The camera is setup to handle a beginner from day one. All of the menus have clear explanations of the functions. The camera has a fully automatic mode. This means it can operate like your point and shoot camera until you learn the extra features. There are also separate auto functions that allow you to make some adjustments without going fully manual.Focus: The focus speed and quality is incredible with a camera like this. It&#8217;s great for taking pictures of kids. You can easily capture several shots in a row of that special moment. There&#8217;s no waiting for a slow point and shoot to achieve focus.HD Video: The camera can also function as a camcorder. The recording quality is HD. The camera has a fold out/tilting screen to make video recording easier.Battery Life: The battery life is incredible. If you use the eye piece for shooting and the LCD only for viewing the shot the battery can easily last long enough that you&#8217;ll forget when it was charged last.We&#8217;re extremely happy that we went with the T3i. It&#8217;s been getting continual use since our son was born in the hospital. We used it to do our own newborn photo shoot. All of our family and friends were impressed with the pictures on our announcements and thank you cards."

Cumbersome at first, but have enjoyed the jump in quality and versatility of DSLR. Need a good understanding of manual settings (basic photography).  Found a good 18-250 zoom needed for outdoor action videos at a summer camp.  Adding Magic Lantern has been just the ticket.  Would not recommend for run-and-gun style video as is typical with camcorders though.  I had to re-think and change my camcorder shooting style, but have adapted successfully.

However, this camera really doesn't have any standout features.  Its the same old technology that has been around for years.  You are still going to have to wait a ton of time between shots, the burst mode is slow, and the burst mode does not support focusing between shots.  The view finder is not going to actually show you the picture you are going to get since it is an optical viewfinder.  And the viewfinder is going to black out when you actually take the shot.  Sure, all these traditional SLR cameras take great pictures, but really, what camera at this price doesn't.  What are you really looking for at this price point?  For me, it is fast between shots and can burst fast so I am sure to get a great shot.  I hate cameras that make me wait between shots until the camera is ready to take another picture.If you want the hidden gem in the SLR camera world, check out the Sony SLT technology.  It is a new technology that is much faster and allows the viewfinder and focus mechanisms to function like they should.  I have the SLT-A57 and I think you can tell from the reviews that it is as good or better than any of these SLR cameras.No, I don't work for Sony.  I just think that someone should point out the fact that there are other options out there and better technology available."

I've owned my 600d for close to a year, and taken hundreds of photos with it.  This was my first foray beyond point-and-shoots.The main problem I have is the idea of a 'consumer' level DSLR.  I've paid several times more for lenses than I did for the camera.  After investing in the glass I find myself wondering why I didn't just get the 5d and been done with it.I guess that's the crux of the matter.  Anyone who would be happy with the basic kit, nifty fifty, and a couple other lenses like the 75-300 would be better served by a bridge camera or superzoom.  Anyone who's willing to outlay the cash for red rings would be better off with the 5d.  I just don't see the purpose for lower end DSLRs as anything more than a stop-gap or learning tool, tasks that could be done just as easily by the 1100d or even, gasp, an old film SLR.On a side note, unless you're at the end of your budget, don't get the 18-55 kit lens.  It will leave you wanting on almost every shot.  Spend a little more on a good prime, even the 40mm f2.8 is a marked improvement over the s*** kit lens."

I purchased the body only - I have several lenses from my previous Canons which are NOT currently 'IS' lenses. I've been shooting people, places and other things for more than 45 years and LOVE this camera. It's extremely mobile. I can just flip open my tripod lock and GO! My only issue with the T3i concerns the GRID functions. These work only in LIVE VIEW MODE (as I've found so far). As soon as you move up to manual for full control, you lose the grid (I use the 3x3), which helps me set my composition. Yes, I can use my eye to place an imaginary grid in the viewfinder, but WHY when one is readily available.With my additions on the camera already, video/image reviews will be plentiful. As I learn new tricks and shortcuts, I'll inform the public so they too can enjoy ALL of the features of this outstanding camera. The articulating screen wasn't necessary, yet it IS what made me choose this model over the T2i. The prices were just too close to pass it up. I'll be adding more T3i and T2i cameras to my photo biz in the coming months, as well as trying out the 'IS' lenses. This camera is very tight on power consumption and has extreme accuracy when you set it for pinpoint focusing as I do for model and portrait photography work. The macro features are also on par with its more advanced (and WAY higher priced), big brothers to this camera. Now, the 18.1MP sensor.....WOW! The image sizes of the CMOS sensor allow me great latitude in adjusting and tweaking my RAW images anytime I wish to be creative. If you are just starting out, are bored with the out of date 'point-n-shoot,' want to upgrade your digital cams, or you want to move from film to digital, the T3i will not disappoint. It's an excellent camera for ANY level of photographer - beginner or experienced pro, this camera really shines. Oh, and the video.....It's 1080p HD, nothing more needs to be said.I ordered it here at Amazon, really a great price: http://amzn.to/128qxby"

This is my first digital SLR as I finally joined the digital club when the my 35MM SLR finally broke (yeah, I'm a bit late). I've used numerous canon products before (Elan, Rebel, SX110, 120), So I'm kinda familar with SLR and digital functions. I decided on the rebel series as a point of entry to the DSLR world due to the price to function ratio being extremely attractive. I needed a full function of an SLR that allows me to attach a long telephoto lense (Sigma 120-400mm - see my other review on this lense) for wildlife. My expectation was in the mid range due to the canon namesake and various functionality (3.7fps, B&W, HD movies and tilting LCD) and compatibility with my older stuff from flim days (70-210 mm and 380EX flash - TTL even works too!).I'm goign to pass on the pros and cons for this camera since most of them has been discussed thoroughly by other reviewers. However, the biggest suprise for me is how robust the camera body is. My camera fell off my backpack while I was galloping on horseback in the mountains of Ecuador and subsequently and after careful inspection, I found that the camera remains fully functional with only cosmetics issues. When it happened I thought that I need to purchase another camera for the rest of my trip as I was quite convience that the fall would have shattered my camera. Just FYI, I was not galloping at full speed and it was on dirt trail, but still I am very impressed by how solid the camera was build to sustain such impact. On the disappointing side, at higher end of the ISO, the performance of the camera definitely is not as good as those higher end like the 6D and up.Bottomline : I would recommend this camera to those who wish to venture into DSLR as price point to performance is very attractive, especially now with newer models of rebels. Also, works with your older equipment from your flim days (if any of you guys are still around). Plus, the robustness of the body definitely deserve a 5 star rating!.DMAN"

FROM 1 STAR TO 4.I have been a hardcore Canon fan for more than a quarter century.  I have owned a couple of pre-Rebel cameras, 5 Rebels - 2 film, 3 digital - 2 video recorders, 2 photo printers, and too many lenses, filters, and accessories to inventory here.  I have been faithful to the brand because I have never had a dud or even a problem though I've treated the items with anything but kid gloves.  With the exception of this camera, all items purchased continue to function perfectly even though I have been extremely tough on many of them.  For example, several of the earlier cameras and lenses have been exposed to desert environments (dust storms, heat exceeding 105 degrees, and no shade for hours at a time), challenging uses (took one or more at a time rock climbing & strapped it/them - camera & lens - to me as I climbed.  Needless to say it/they banged against the rock face several times during these adventures), and dampness, sometimes extreme (coastal environments, beaches, storms, rain, etc.).  In spite of the abuse, and lack of regular care or cleaning, they all continued to perform wonderfully.  Then came along the T3i.  Knowing I was planning another trip to Costa Rica in February 2012, I decided to again upgrade my digital Rebel collection in December 2011.  I received the new camera promptly & was excited by it's look and feel, a wonderful improvement over some earlier versions.  Still easy to use and mostly intuitive, and best of all, loved the pictures I got - super clear and sharp!  I thought this was my best purchase yet!So, what's my problem?  Since I made this purchase I used this camera (lightly and gently) on my Costa Rica trip, a 3 day trip to Moab, Utah, and for a portion of a child's Easter egg hunt on Easter Sunday 2013.  Why only for a portion?  Because half way through the egg hunt the camera would no longer auto focus.*  I have done everything I can think of to get it to work.  I have charged, then changed the batteries, tried different lens that work with other Rebels, made sure the lens I was using worked on the others cameras, cleaned the contacts and camera thoroughly.  Nothing.  I can't sense to get a decent shot out of this camera anymore.  So, I decide to take it to a camera shop to see if I can get it repaired, and they tell me the cost is 175 dollars just to look at it, and it will likely cost several hundred to fix.  So it seems my 600 dollar, nearly new/almost unused camera will cost me as much or more than I paid for it to fix it after two and a half light uses?  Suddenly not such a fan of Canon or their Rebel line.By the way - the camera and lenses were all properly stored in dry, cool space with plenty of padding and dust protection along with my older equipment which continues to function flawlessly in spite of how rough I was with them (the older items) when I was younger and more daring.*I often use auto focus these days because as I get older the camera 'sees' much more clearly than I do, especially when my 'targets' are moving, such as children 'hunting' eggs.UPDATE:Ok, I feel really dumb now.  Being determined not to spend as much as I paid for the camera to have it fixed, I have been holding out, using other cameras, and playing with my T3i periodically to see if there was an easy fix.  For whatever reason, it only occurred to be this morning to check the dioptric adjustment knob and some of the buttons on the back of the camera for unintended adjustments.  Sure enough that was the problem.  After checking the dioptric adjustment, which moves very freely on my camera, and some of the buttons on the back (still not sure quite what I did here) my camera is back as good as ever.  I must have touched these adjustments while putting the camera in my case or taking it out.  I've never had this happen with any of my other cameras.  Caused a fair amount of frustration, but in the end I probably have to own some of the problem.  With that said, I also don't think it should be so easy to completely mess up settings on a camera, so I'm keeping one star for what I consider a design or manufacturing flaw (not sure which)."

So far I am quite impressed with picture quality but not amazed. I thought camera should take better pictures. That could be due to the fact that I am new to DSLRs and also the included Kit Lens has some limitations. I may buy the nifty fifty and see how good the pictures turn out.UPDATE - Changing the rating to 5 stars. Amazing camera. The only regret I have is purchasing it with 18-55 mm lens. I should have purchased body only. 18-55 is good for nothing lens. I ended up buying 55-250 zoom lens which is awesome and 40 mm STM which perfect for closeup shots and videos.

With 18 megapixels, full HD video, and the Canon name, it'll still be high tech in 10 years +. The two main upgrades from the T3 are 12.2 vs. 18 megapixels, and the fact that the T3i has an articulated screen. And you WILL use the articulated screen often -- for overhead shots, low angle shots, self portraits, setting up tripod based video/still shots (flip the screen around so you can see your shot as you tweak backgrounds).Bought mine as a package deal from Cardinal Camera (best prices ANYWHERE).  Skip the package with the 75-300mm zoom.  Get the package with the 55-250mm IS zoom.  (more below on that)The two main T3i upgrade points (megapixels and articulated screen) do make it cost a good bit more than the T3, but the upgrades are well worth it. As for the 75-300 vs 55-250 IS lens -- IS is the key - image stabilization. A friend of mine with the 75-300 lens said, 'It's practically worthless. I'll sell it to you for 10 bucks. I hate that lens.' Without IS, you're doomed unless it's a cloudless day at high noon, or you're carrying a tripod around with you, or you're zoomed out to less than 150mm or so. I don't recall the exact numbers, but I believe IS gives you something like 4 additional stops before your shots get blurry. That's major, and again, well worth the extra money.  And with the 55-250 IS lens, you won't miss the 50mm difference.  In fact, if you want to zoom in that much, you'd be better off blowing up your pic taken with the IS lens.  It'll still be sharper than a pic with at 300mm zoom.After an exhaustive search, I found Cardinal Camera had the best deal on a T3i package. In fact, best deals anywhere on the T3i and a number of other cameras I was considering. Came quickly in a carefully packed box. Lots of goodies, though I will probably get some higher quality uv filters to protect my lenses - filters with multilayer coating to reduce glare. If you want to carry the goodies around, they practically fill the included bag. Not enough room for all of it, plus the camera.Next time I'm in the market for photography supplies, Cardinal Camera will be my first stop. I don't know when that will be though. I'm perfectly happy with my T3i. Like it a whole lot better than I would a T3 or anything similar, and I didn't see a need to go way up in price to a T4i.If you're still on the fence about spending a big chunk of change on a camera, just go for it. This camera isn't a piece of technology. It's a stack of priceless photo albums. It's vacation pictures worthy of framing. It's family portraits. It's memories."

Its not worth getting a DSLR in general if your just going to keep it on auto-shot and really you don't get much from the camera if you do so, especially considering how large it is. If your just looking for better image quality I'd say go for a mirrorless interchangeable lens or 'compact system' camera (as they call it on amazon)but if your willing to learn ( or through trial and error) you can get stunning and beautiful shots in conditions you never thought possible, I have really been breath taken by some of the photos as they appear for the first time on my computer monitor, then my jaw really dropped again when I started shooting in RAW format and editing in photoshop, but again, you have to be willing to tinker with settings/modes and eventually lenses, but once you do so you'll never want to go back.  Well now that your looking at entering the field of semipro/ enthusiasts photography this is one of, if not, the best entry cameras you can get. The camera delivers in almost every front, in terms of image quality, options, versatility, and only falls slightly short on its continuous shooting rate, as well as the auto focus can and will fail in low light and tricky conditions, this can simply be overridden by manual focus which isn't difficult once you get the hang of it. If you can afford it, get a new lens, the lens this comes paired with is decent but the auto focus is slow. Cannon (as well as 3rd party companies like sigma) have a huge range of great lenses and while lenses are expensive, keep in mind they will last a lot longer then the camera itself. Moving on, the flip screen is very useful for low/ high angles and I've taken some interesting backwards shots. In terms of video, the built in microphone is good for what it is, but if your a little serious, you want to grab and external mic, which it does have support for. Now the only tricky thing in video is that it does not have continuous autofocus, so time to beef up that manual focus skill. It has a HDMI out, so you can view directly on your TV, and the neat software by cannon allows you to view and control your camera through your computer when its hooked via USB. The battery lasts for ages and can be swapped out, the flash provided is fine but is rarely used as it makes most situations harsh without the ability to control the strength like an attached flash does/some DSLRs(it does have a standard mount. finally I wish this camera had GPS for geotaging pictures, not essential but would be nice.In Review, this is a great camera, and will get you very far in photography, with few limitations except your own knowledge and imagination."

For the price and specifications of the camera, nothing could beat it.  I just purchased the body and invested in a prime, as well as a nicer zoom and wide angle lens.  I've taken thousands of pictures on this camera.  I went on a road trip this summer, visiting a bunch of National Parks, and I loved how my pictures turned out.  It's an easy to use camera, ideal for beginners, but even for those who like to shoot manually, like me.  I'd recommend this over the T4i for the price.  Nothing is different other than autofocus/mic input and I don't think that justifies the price difference."

Since I take most of my pictures inside, I had to return it because of the erratic inside focusing. Outside, it was wonderful."
"227","XX","B004J3V90Y","5.0","8","8","November 15, 2013","A1IU7S4HCK1XK0","Out of date T3i is a budget choice that may work","The market for 'entry level' and 'mid-level' DSLR's (digital single lens reflex) cameras is crowded, and not helped by Japanese manufacturers' penchant for loading their product line with revisions and new versions, all on the market at the same time. Choosing a camera that works for you, while wondering what to spend is a difficult task. I'm still using the 2nd edition of the Rebel, a 6.6 Megapixel camera without video and it's become obvious that I want more resolution (more megapixels) and more features. The T3i, though now two versions below the current T5i, is a strong contender.What you give up: If you choose 'entry level' you are giving up some new features you may or may not want; for example, the mid-level 70D Canon has wifi. While this may seem frivolous, during a recent trip to a remote area, I personally would have loved wifi on my camera as I was trying not to have to bring every electronic device under the sun with me, and opted only for a Kindle -- no laptop. This was a good choice, as hotels had wifi and the Kindle is decent enough as a tablet-substitute, but I could not upload and share photos with locals who wanted a shot I took of a rare bird. Wifi would have given instant access to online photo editing, or sharing.Mid level also means a better processor (speed, better interpretation of images, less noise), a more advance video system, better viewfinder and waterproofing. If any of these features are sounding desirable, you should consider a mid level such as a 70D and skip the Rebel.If cost is paramount, however, the Rebel T3i has a lot to offer. For one thing, it is easy to use. The controls are logically laid out, and though you have plenty of choices of mode (manual, shutter or aperture preferred, for example) the automatic mode is fast and easy and great for grabbing quick shots in tough situations. I find I can grab quick shots with no fumbling, and that is something that is important if you are shooting sports or nature, for example.The Rebel T3i came out early 2011. It still is one of  Canon's most popular DSLR camera, followed by the Rebel T4i. It is preferred even over the 60D (the midlevel predecessor to the 70D, which added wifi.) The T4i and T5i are practically the same, but add a newer processor, faster shutter speed and more noise reduction; if you notice noise and want 5 frames per second, and a touch screen, you'll want the T4i or T5i. It is also better in low light situations, again, what do you like to shoot? If you do low light, if you are doing multi-shot, sports photography, you may want the newer version Rebel and skip the T3i.The T3i has 18-megapixel APS-C CMOS sensor with image quality that is not inferior to the more expensive 60D. The 63-zone dual-layer exposure metering system is entirely adequate for most situations.You can buy it with the usual 18-55mm EF lens, but this is a lens that I don't prefer--it's a good point-and-shoot choice, with wide-angle to mid telephoto focal length, but a more versatile choice is something like a 28-to-105mm which gets you from wide angle to portrait-telephoto without lens changes. Adding a 70-300 for nature shots would equip you very well with minimal need for lens changes. (It all depends on what you shoot--I like action and nature shots while walking in areas that are not amenable to fiddling with camera equipment, so I try not to have lens changes. If you shoot on a tripod, at sporting events in stands, in areas where you have leisure to adjust your equipment, you can choose lenses to suit your application, ie wide angle for real-estate photography or interiors, telephoto on a tripod in a bird blind.)The rear of the camera has a fully articulating 3-inch LCD with a 3:2 aspect ratio. This is a bright, easy to use screen. The viewfinder is what you use for still shots, but if you plan to do videos, the fold-out screen is almost essential.  You can do HD videos with relative ease, choosing different aspect ratios.Bottom line: If you are moving from 'point and shoot' fixed lens cameras to a DSLR, and do not want to spend a lot of cash, or if you prefer to spend on the lens and budget for the camera body, the T3i is a stellar choice. If you need some weatherproofing or wifi or more advanced processing and you have moved past your original entry-level DLSR, you might consider whether it is worth spending almost 3X more to get the features of the 70D. If you are shooting low light and want the newer shutter speed and processor, a budget choice may be the newer T4i or T5i, which is a few hundred more but not as much as the 70D."
"228","XX","B004J3V90Y","5.0","5","6","November 13, 2013","ABXM4NBX66JY7","Perfect for nature photography, but still a great camera in all categories.","Amazing camera, I was between the T3i and the T3. The difference was about $100 (the T3i was on sale) and the flip out LCD and increased resolution were well worth it. I take it out at night for photographs of the stars and the 18MP vs. 12.2MP is a noticable difference. I also photograph airplanes and so it helps to have that little bit of increased resolution when I blow those photos up to poster size. If you are only wanting a camera for head shots in a stuido or close up shots of yourself and other people; for a tourist camera, then I would go with the T3 or even the T2, but if you do landscape photography this is the only option. Get a fish eye lens and you will have the best photos of expansive landscapes. I take mine hiking, camping and bouldering.  Definitely invest in a UV filter protector though; it's only about $7, but it has saved my $500 lens from being cracked and is really durable. Tiffen makes a great one 58mm fits for the T3i. Also, if you go hiking, get a camera bag, a back pack case works best because it doesn't swing around and hit things as you walk or climb and you can put other accessories and snacks or drinks in the bag."

But life caught up to my dream world and sadly I had to sell off my equipment. Most people might think that this would be a downgrade from my past cameras but the funny thing about photography is, if you have a camera, you have all that you need.This camera does everything I need it to do. The sensor might not be a full frame but I make up for it by using higher quality lenses.The video capabilities are great.The one thing I would have to say, as a word of wisdom is...buy a cheaper body that will do everything you need it to do (minimum). And invest in GREAT lenses. I cannot explain, express, or put into English HOW important a GREAT lens is.So if I could say buy it? 5 out or 5"

What do I see is how light and easy to use t3i is. I am sure a 2.5K is much better than t3i. It has to be. However, for the amateur photographer who just likes to shoot pictures of his kids, friends, vacation sights t3i is the best camera. I will still probably keep 6D and use t3i."

So let me keep it short and simple.If you're new, this camera with a kit lens is NOT going to disappoint. There's so much to learn on it right off the bat that you will not notice any of the things more experienced photographers might complain about (then again, you're spending way less too!). Excellent pictures. Excellent videos. As one reviewer put it 99% of people looking at your photos are going to see a beautiful picture. The other 1% are professional photographers who are nitpicking things you don't care about or notice.Camera takes brilliant pictures in auto, and even more brilliant pictures once you learn you play around with the settings. If you're trying to decide between this and another camera, do what I did. Write down what you want. Then go watch review videos with a pad and paper. Write pros and cons of each, then see what works best for you. I was comparing to the Nikon D5100 and found that since I want to do more with video, I wanted this for its better manual video and audio controls. While the 5100 has somewhat of a continuous autofocus, many complain that it doesn't give you much control and I find the T3i manual focus a breeze to use in video. Allows you to get more creative too.Anyway, whatever you decide, the Nikon and Canon DSLRs are all great cameras. Write down what you want your camera for, write pros and cons of each camera, quit stressing, order, and start shooting!Good luck!"

I've been interested in photography for some time and finally decided to put down my mega zoom camera and pick up a real camera. I received this camera for Christmas(2012) So currently I've been using it for a good two months. Just comparing this camera to other DSLR's this camera feels very plasticky, and the exterior body will scratch fairly easily, its a tad heavy for how cheap it feels but that could be a good/ bad thing depending on the use.The kit lens (18-55 mm) does a decent job obtaining high resolution images paired with the 18 megapixel sensor.  The swivel screen really isn't a big deal to me and seems more like a gimmick than something people will actually get use out of, since I do not use live view mode very often to frame my shots. Autofocus is horrendous, just warning any first timers out there who are like me and had no clue at the beginning. Using the autofocus in live view mode could possibly be one of the most frustrating things I've ever experienced in my life. This is a good camera for still frame/portraits,and not so much action shots just due to the fact the autofocus sucks.The battery life fairs pretty well for what I use it for(trips to the zoo, the occasional landscape shot, and everyday use) and I find myself charging it once every week or so. That being said people who are far more serious than I about their photography will probably need some sort of 3rd party equipment to help extend the battery life during hardcore continuous use.Though with the few gripes I do have about this camera it really has helped me grow and learn as a beginning photographer. The menus are very easy to navigate and I love creative mode because it helps the beginner to get out of auto mode without losing the extra help auto provides. Canon probably has the widest range of lenses available compared to any other brand. Although I have recently gotten my hands on a NIKON D3200 and I have to say I wish I would have started with that and might possibly be ditching my Canon Rebel t3i soon for it. I can't get over how smooth the autofocus on the D3200 is. I mean if both cameras were like food the D3200 would be like butter, smooth and creamy. The t3i would be like vegetable oil greasy but works for everyday use."

It's relatively cheap for the quality that you get out of it. My passion for photography was always with me from a young age but I only recently really got into it. I bought this camera in future shop downtown Toronto last year December. The body is made of plastic and if it gets lightly scratched or nicked rubbing the area with your finger removes the scratch. I was blown away by the quality of the pictures this camera provided me with. It was my first DSLR ever. I used to use a Kodak 5MP point and shoot and then moved to my Sony Ericsson Xperia Arc 8MP phone. When I got this camera I dived straight into using manual mode. It is the best way to learn. I live in the Caribbean on an island called Trinidad and Tobago. It's too expensive to ship items out of the country or fix here so I needed to make sure the camera works perfectly. I used this camera in doors and out doors in very cold weather and it held up amazingly. I was a bit skeptical of the Flip screen, living in Trinidad if it broke off or damaged it would be too expensive to repair. (Might as well buy over a new camera body). My fears are no longer, I constantly flip the screen whether it's for video recording of picture taking. It's well designed and built. It is a crop sensor camera which means the lens length is longer. Multiply the 18-55mm standard kit lens by a cropped 1.6 sensor and your lens becomes 28.8-88mm. While it is true most times that the glass (lenses) you buy for your camera are what make the image look amazing because of the optics etc..I have read online many times where people cry down the standard kit lens you get with this. This kit lens is an amazing lens for learning on, so if you're new to photography go ahead and get the lens on the body. If your more of a seasoned photog well you will know to buy the camera body alone and hopefully you already have some prime glass. Checkout some of my pictures on flickr at amazon won't let me paste the link so here is how to see my pictures. In the URL type in [...]  Many of these pictures were taken with the Canon EOS Rebel T3i.Update Wednesday 20th March 2013This Camera Body is the best, I have taken thousands of photos with it already and it's still going strong. Definitely be careful swapping out lenses in any windy area that you know could potentially carry dust, dirt or sand particles that could get into your camera. I took my T3i on the beach last week to get some shots. I got down low enough to get a couple shots but it never touched the sand. However I was swapping out my telephoto lens for my kit lens and some sort of particle got onto the mirror of the camera. I could see it through the viewfinder. Got me scared I tell ya! I was lucky though I was able to blow it out on my own right there at the beach without it going anywhere further inside near the sensor. I got some awesome shots. It rained very lightly so the camera did get a few drops of rainwater on it. Stashed it in my camera bag till I got to shelter and gave it a quick wipe down. Still works. I flip the screen out more than I thought I would, up to now it's still solid as a rock. I only used one battery that day I didn't need to swap another battery in, the camera was on for more than 4 full hours and got around 550 shots that day. I did notice at times of above average use the grip area near the battery compartment did get relatively warm as the battery got hot. When I mean hot I don't mean extremely hot but you can tell the difference. Check out some of my shots on flickrUpdate- Wednesday 4th December 2013Hey Everyone, just giving a quick update. My Canon Rebel T3i will be making a year in about 14 days or so. I am still in love with this camera, even more than on day one actually. I only shoot in Manual Mode and RAW files. This Camera is a BEAST!! Since I last updated my review of this camera I have used it particularly at outdoor,water and powder based events. IN particular Hardcore Caribbean, Water Wars and Kaleidodash Trinidad. Each brought a different challenge. The hand grip area is perfect for holding for long hours. All buttons are still in tact and none are loose. The Flip screen is in perfect condition. 0 scratches and 0% failure. This camera did get soaked down at the cooler party called water wars. I was literally soaked down by a similar hose to those firefighters use. My camera was soaked, all the buttons got wet all the screen. Ended up giving it a quick dry down but seeing as I was soaked as well the camera stayed wet for that entire evening event. At kaleidodash, powders were thrown on me and got onto the camera body, lenses and flash. I tried my best to clean out the crevices of the camera but to this day the coloured powder still remains in between a couple of the buttons and the Canon logo. I used one lens in particular for these events, the 24-105mm F4 L lens which has a small rubber gasket to help fight water from getting in. The flash used for these events was the Young-Nuo YN 560 3.As of today I have clocked 26,155 shutter actuations on this camera in less than a year. The camera is starting to show some signs of wear. The front of the hand grip area of my camera is now slightly pushing out. It could be the sealant is giving way. This could be because of the soaking it got (did shoot in light rain a few times as well) mixed with the constant heat in the Caribbean. My camera screen did flicker once when I put it on but at the time it did this I was using an after market battery. I don't usually record video however i do small tests for my personal use. At times I do find there is a white noise line in the playback of the videos. Not sure what that is. The lens checks out fine. I noticed when I set my camera lens to auto focus in relatively dim light it forever searches for a subject to focus on which is too slow for me. It's faster for me to manually focus and shoot at the night parties. The highest ISO I mostly shoot at is ISO 800 but am noticing a bit of quality degradation.I am looking to upgrade to the Canon 70D for the new year due to the 'better' specs. I need the higher ISO for many of the night events I do. Double the shutter speed is a bonus even though I haven't had the chance to shoot at the T3i's max 4000. The Weather Sealing is much better for the shooting I do. If I had the finances I would have moved directly to the Canon 5D Mark 3. I don't look forward to built in Wifi or Touch screen. Especially having used my cell phones touch screen with a slightly sweaty hand. I won't be putting my T3i down altogether yet though. The T3i will act as a backup of mine when I get the 70D. I have recently met a person who invested all his money in buying a T5i and a backup T4i both brand new with some basic lenses. Had I met them before they bought what they did I would have strongly encouraged them to buy the T3i with one good quality lens and a couple extra batteries. Even though the camera isn't a year old yet and is showing many signs of wear and tear, I would say it held up pretty well towards everything I put it through. Definitely a fantastic camera.Find me on Flickr~Go to Flickr~Then type in a '/' then 'photos' then '/' and last type in 'suipeter'And that should take you there."

I did take a basic photography course to teach me how to use it which was highly useful.  If you've had a Canon before, the basic menu and layout are similar to your previous cameras.  This is one of the reasons why I wanted to stick with Canon since I was already familiar with it.  In general it works great and the pictures are good.  Of course a camera is only as good as the photographer and since I am an amateur I can't really comment on all the details like I'm sure others can.I knocked it down one star b/c I've owned it less than a year and I've had to send it back for a repair that I hope is covered by warranty.  The flash isn't working at all in auto mode.  It pops up and fire but the pictures all come out underexposed.  If I manually lower the flash after it pops up, the pictures come out fine.  There's something wrong...just don't know what exactly so they're looking into it for me.  I will come back and update on their customer service once I find out what they're able to do to fix it.ETA:  Got my camera back from Canon in perfect working order.  Since I was still within the one year warranty, I mailed it to them (on my dime but it was only around $12) to be repaired.  The repair was covered under warranty and I now have my camera back!

The picture quality is excellent! I wish i would have gotten this sooner. I am not camera guru or anything like that. Lack of knowledge when it comes to photography and about cameras.  After I bought the camera some of my friends told me to buy Nikkon. So far I don't regret it.Before I continue I want to say that the next paragraph may be helpful, take for what it is worth from a simple minded person in this area:There is a lot of features to the camera that I am sure that I will never use mostly because i did not see a difference when testing them out.  The movie HD is nice to have and I used it for the first time and I am grateful for it when something happens and need video camera in a matter of seconds. Make sure you read the manual and experiment with the options. Another feature that is pretty cool, you don't have to go through the photo on your memory card one by one when you go through the pictures on the camera, You can break up the photo up to 9 thumbnail so it will save you the time and hassle of pushing the next button.  The battery keeps it charge and doesn't take long to bring it back to a full charge.  The one negative thing for me was auto setting shooting.  I let the camera do all the work and there is a long gap between the auto-focus and when it take the pictures.  I quite often want to take 4-5 pictures in a quick second to get the timing of a little kid who don't want to sit for 15 seconds for three pictures that are the same.Lastly, I read a lot of review the good and bad, and I from a simple point of view: It takes a great high quality pictures, It has all of the bells and whistle (maybe too much for me), but i like to have the options, who knows when they will be handy.  If you are looking for the camera with my mindset, i have to say it is perfect fit for me.  It is a little pricey but looking at some of the pictures i now know that I will get great pictures and not have to worry about all of imperfections of a cheap ($100-$250) camera with a lot of megapixel. Peace in mind knowing that is great to have on your side"

The picture quality is no doubt amazing, the 18 megapixel sensor delivers exceptional performance. I'll upload some pictures that I've taken with it. For beginners, I strongly recommend auto settings for your pictures until you get used to the camera, and want to experiment around. The T3i is not a hard camera to master. In fact, all you need is a full battery and a good lens, and you're all set, just switch it to auto and shoot away. The screen on the body of the camera is also very high quality, on my 20d, the screen is very small and dark, therefore very hard to see in the sunlight. The T3i screen is very bright so it is very easy to see. The ports on the camera include a micro hdmi port, digital av (cable included) an SD card slot, the main storage for all your photos, a 3.5 mm headphone port and another port that I'm not sure what it is.

Someone can correct me if I'm wrong.  Anyway, I like having the versatile lens rather than changing lenses every time I want to do a more telephotic shot.  Anyway, on automatic settings, works beautifully . . . none of that hesitation that I used to get with my Olympus.  Also, like the feature that you can just turn the wheel on top to take non-flash photos (instead of having to go to the menu to do so).  Low light photos are amazing, and the flash doesn't usually wash out the photo.  So far (only had this camera for a month now), has performed well for holiday photos.  I'm looking forward to traveling with this camera (it is a bit heavier than I was used to with my Olympus, but mostly due to the larger lens, I believe)."

"357","XX","B004J3V90Y","5.0","1","1","January 15, 2013","A1GVYDM5OC118V","A Beginner's Dream","I will preface this review by stating that I am not a camera expert and am still learning much of the functionality of this camera.  I do know the concepts of white balance, aperture, frame rate, f stops, shutter speed and other functions however, I am not all that familiar on their use and which settings are best for which shots.  I have worked with a higher end video camera and do know some things about shot composition and such, but again, only at a basic level.All that being said, here is my review.A simple two-sentence, simple, bottom line review: This camera allows me to capture ideas and shots, even in automatic mode, that if attempted with a simple point and shoot camera would look like garbage.  It has enabled me to make ideas I've had in the past into a reality which makes it worth the money.OK, so maybe that doesn't cut it for an in-depth review.The Canon T3i has a fairly rugged design and feels good in the hand.  It does not feel as heavy as it looks and has a variety of easy-to-access controls for adjusting all manner of settings and features on the camera.The camera is simple enough for a beginner to take a quick glance at the included guide, throw it into Automatic + mode and capture some great shots right out of the box.  However, it is also complex enough that a more skilled photographer or someone who wants to become one will have all the room they need to compose magazine-worthy works of art.The lens that comes with the camera, the EF-S 18-55mm is a great starter lens for medium to close up shots.  My wife and I purchased this camera from another retailer along with a Canon EF-S 55-250mm f/4.0-5.6 IS II Telephoto Zoom Lens.A WARNING: To those hunting for great deals out there, do not be duped into getting a package deal with a poor telephoto lens as an add-on.  Always research what you are getting, otherwise you can end up with a cheap telephoto lens that has no image stabilization.  Image stabilization is what keeps the lens and image balanced and is an absolute must for a telephoto lens.The above lenses are of the same family and will give the average photographer the variety they will need to accommodate the majority of the shots they will be taking.  However, Canon also has an extensive line of lenses in their EF and EFS family that will fit this camera body for higher image quality or specialized uses.The photo quality is superb.  The average user will be satisfied with the 18megapixel image compressed as a 5MB Jpeg file.  Advanced users will love the access to Canon's RAW format, which is literally the digital picture data as captured by the image sensor in the camera.  This allows for advanced tweaking and manipulation of the photo.The T3i does have a full 1080p HD video mode, however, I have not used it at this point in time and cannot review it for that reason.  However, I can say that if the image quality of the still images are indicative of the picture quality of the HD video, it will be a treat.Overall, I will say that this camera is well worth the money for someone looking to take a step up from the dull world of point and shoot.  It will give a user room to grow and learn more about photography.  For more advanced users it is a great mid-range option that has a huge level of control over shots.  That being said, this camera, like any tool, is only as good as its user.  The A+ mode will allow for pretty good shots without adjusting settings, however, a user will get the most out of it by learning more about photography and delving into the full feature set of the camera."

You know how it is....the entire time he is taking pictures with his Nikon D80 (he fancies himself a fantastic photographer...and he is), I am constantly in his ear telling how what I see and envision would make a better picture. I also tell him how he should take a picture of something that I believe will make him the next Ansel Adams. And I complete the photo shoot with,  'if only I had really good camera, I would'..... Well,  I guess he was tired of hearing it, and decided to buy me this camera (for Christmas thru Amazon) if for no other reason than to shut me up. I guess it was his way of putting 'his' money where 'my' mouth is, and I was delighted.Now what is there to like about this camera.-This camera is user friendly and great for a beginner photographer or at least one that is ready to move from a camera like a Nikon CoolPix. It is perfect for still shots and video (HD). It is easy to select a setting (portrait, action, etc), point and shoot. It focuses automatically (press halfway) and can be manually adjusted (tight or far away photos). There is a menu that allows you to edit and even make images, black and white. **Please note that this is the one feature that no matter how much I read the manual, I can't quite get it to do what I would like. I can edit a picture, change it to black & white, and even use the zoom tool, but when I attempt to save it, it won't.  That is a feature that I will have to continue to fool with. And if anyone can help me, I would appreciate it.-You can manipulate the viewing screen...it flips out and turns (for use while recording video) so that you can view it. Or you can swivel, flip and turn the screen around and collapse it against the body of the camera.  This allows you to see or view the pictures you are taking or have taken.- This camera takes crisp/clear photos. They are amazingly clear.-This camera has a continuously shoot feature/function. It is great for my son's wrestling matches.-This camera has an automatic flash that is useful if you aren't sure about the lighting.-This camera is light (weight wise) enough to carry around for a long period of time (your hand won't get tired), but it also comes with a comfortable and adjustable neck strap. There are also cords that come with the camera so that you can use with the computer or TV.-The battery life is decent. I assume that it also depends on how many videos you do versus still shots. However, I have done both and found and didn't have a problem.  This camera also comes with a convenient battery charger.Overall, I love my new Canon Rebel T3i and look forward to (a) learning everything about it that I can and (2) taking tons of fantastic pictures for years to come."

Yes, it is a crop sensor so you won't get full frame out of your lens, but overall it's an amazing camera. Just beware, once you start shooting, you'll get addicted and it's an expensive hobby. Although the auto modes are good in a snap, some of my best pictures have come from fiddling around in the manual mode which you just can't beat! If you want to delve into videography, this is an awesome camera as well and can get you that filmic look that you want. I won't profess to be an expert at the t3i (I'm still learning stuff everyday), but the features are intuitive and it's a great camera! BUY IT! There are a few features that really stand out in my mind:- Swivel LCD screen - This is not cheaply made, it's got a nice sturdy feel to it and can be switched into a variety of angles to help you get that perfect shot!- Kit Lens - I've tried the 50mm 1.8, but the kit lens is pretty sweet too. You've got to really have ideal settings to get good footage, but it helps you learn how to use a DSLR- Video mode - It's pretty intuitive and takes great HQ video! I'm impressed!- The camera itself has a nice weight to it! It doesn't feel cheap or fragile (I wouldn't drop it of course).I haven't had the camera long enough and I don't know enough about photography to figure out any of the cons of the camera, but I've got to say, I'm more impressed than I ever thought I'd be. Definitely a great investment. I can't wait to learn more about photography and the t3i."

I can't wait to learn everything there is to learn (which will take I while by the looks of it, but that's a good thing!) Overall, I'd definitely recommend. I got it fifty bucks cheaper than the current price, so some of you might be wondering why you don't just get the t4i as they're currently the same price - to that I say, if you plan on going up to bigger, professional DSLR's, stick with the t3i because you're going to need to learn the buttons and you might as well start now. If you're a casual user, then I'd go with the t4i, it's minimally better but it IS better, so if you see the touchscreen as an upgrade, might as well get it for the same price."

I've been an amateur enthusiast for years with many point-and-shoot cameras. I've played with this T3I camera for a few weeks now with differing lighting conditions both indoors and out. I've also tested near and far photo shots, with hand held and tripod mounts. I've included filters and telephotos as well. I have not played with any wide angle lenses yet.LENSES USED:  Canon 18-55mm (Image Stabilization)  Canon 75-300mm (Non-Image Stabilization)  Sigma 18-250 Macro (Image stabilization)  Sigma APO 2x DG EX teleconverter  Vivitar UV filters  Precision Design 2x telephoto  Precision Design wide angle 0.45xPHOTO QUALITY:-T3I camera takes nice photos, but while holding camera by hand, there are some hits and misses of blurred images when subjects move. I have tried different settings including the sports setting. I assume this is due to my not getting used to the camera settings yet? When images don't blur, pictures are awesome.-Another of my cameras, point-and-shoot Canon SX260, takes better pictures than the T3I. I set both cameras on the same tripod and take photos of the same objects in daylight, then with multiple other objects at different locations. Different zoom ranges used for each camera. SX260 takes better photos when viewed at same size using Windows Live Photo Gallery. Possibly me not knowing settings on T3I again? Please note SX260 is one of the best point-and-shoot cameras out there.PHOTOGRAPHER'S VIEWPOINT WHILE TAKING PHOTOS:-With many of my point-and-shoot cameras including the Canon SX130IS, when I manually change the exposure (such as trying to lighten a person's face to show in a really bright background) the screen shows the face darker or lighter, and the photos come out lighter or darker accordingly. If I can see the person's face on the screen, I can see the person's face in the photo. With the T3i, the screen doesn't reflect this. I may be able to see the person's face on the screen, but the photo actually comes out too dark or too light depending on how I manually 'guessed' at the exposure. It amazes me how a DSLR is inferior to multiple cheapy point-and-shoot cameras. Sure, I can take multiple photos to see which is best (but only in a perfect world will all things stand still for me).VIDEO QUALITY:T3I is my only camera ever with absolutely worthless videos. All my point-and-shoots work fine in video. When subjects move closer or farther from the camera, everything is out of focus except for when the subject coincidentally is in that specific focal point. I have played around with the settings. The best I can do is use the shutter button to reset to a new focal point when the subject moves. Even then, the camera takes a while to lock in to the new focal point, by which time the subject has then moved once more. Perhaps videos might work properly if all subjects stay at infinity focal point eventhough they move? The manual confirms camera is not capable of keeping subject in focus if subject moves."

I've been an avid Canon point and shoot user and I actually can make better pictures with my old Ixus 75 then with this one. It doesn't do well with bright backgrounds (skies, sun) and colours are somewhat bleak too. I've been fooling around with the settings and am slowly getting more vivid pictures where contrast and brightness in fore and background is more balanced. The fact that you can take out the display makes it very handy for video and photography from odd angles. The AF is very fast, but too slow in Live view.

I found the T3i is the best. You'd better not focus on the pixel. Pixel means nothing. Especially for the new SLR users and the basic SLRs camera. 18MP is much enough for new user like me. Although many people said T3i didn't have many updates from T2i. But I saw many photos from the Flickr which were taken by the T3i. I think the price is nice. I got this camera with the basic lens, 50mm-250mm lens, 16GB Class 10 SD card and an amazon brand camera bag for $690. What a amazing price is. So, if you are a new SLR user like me, and you don't have a lot of money. This one is your chose."

If you are looking to take rapid pics, this is not your camera.  This is my first DSLR and even I thought it was slow.  After doing more research I found out that if I paid $40 more, I could get the T4.  Why wouldn't I do that?  The T4 is faster, it has more MPs, it has a touch screen, and it can hold two memory cards.  It has in camera HDR and video autofocus.  Now when it originally came out the price was much higher and the T3 was a better bang for your buck, but ever since the price of the T4 came down, it makes no sense to to get the T3."

What I would bring to your attention is the $400 rebate that is offered when you buy this camera and the Canon PIXMA Pro9000 Mark II Inkjet Photo Printer, which I never got. I placed the order for both the camera an the printer back in March 2012. Then I only received the camera, the printer did not come. Amazon refunded me for the printer and told me to place another order for the printer and said that it would still qualify for the rebate. I did as they told me and submitted the rebate documents. And then I waited and waited and did not receive the rebate. I contacted Amazon so many times but they did not solve the problem. For a typical call, the customer service staff would say 'Let me do some research here' and put me on hold and then he would say 'you'll be contacted via email'. Then I got the email saying they needed more information from me but did not specify what they needed, so I had to call them again. Yesterday they finally forwarded my case to their promotion and rebate department. But then I got an email from a promotion and rebate staff saying ' I suggest that you place a new order for the item, Canon PIXMA Pro9000 Mark II Inkjet Photo Printer (3295B002)so that you'll be able to avail of the $200 rebate.  Make sure that the printer is shipped and sold by Amazon.I hope this works for you.'

I'm no professional by any means, but I know enough to figure out why I got a bad shot and make the necessary adjustments to get a better one. This camera has met and exceeded all of my expectations. I certainly have a lot to learn about it still, however it didn't take long for me to figure out the main aspects of all the settings. Its comfortable to hold and carry, and the picture quality is amazing. I'm more of a family portrait shooter as well as just capturing family memories, so I don't use this to take artistic photos by any means, however after playing with it for a while I can see how it would be easy to start learning how to do that as well. So far my favorite feature is the wireless shutter release. Nothing makes the holidays photos as much fun now that I don't have to worry about setting that stupid timer and hoping that i run to the group in time for the shot. Now I can just enjoy the moment take as many photos in as little time necessary to achieve the perfect group shot. I love it!  If you're a person thats ever used the self timer alot, the remote should be a must added accessory!"

It's not too expensive, and it performs extremely well. However, this camera is better suited for photograhy, as indicated by the slightly restricted menu in movie mode. For photography, you have full manual control over pretty much every aspect of your shot, whereas in movie mode, there seem to be a few things missing.Nonetheless, it shoots very well, with no complaints. Just make sure you get your shutter angle at 180 degrees and your videos will look flawless.My only qualm is that at 60fps, the video doesn't record very smoothly, even with my 80mb/s SD card. There are a few glitches in the video, but it still looks fairly well.I got this camera with the kit lens, and it works, at least. You do get what you pay for, so sometimes it's not all that sharp and the autofocus is none too reliable. I have been able to get good pictures and video with it, though.Overall, this camera is great for someone just starting out, as it offers great quality video and photographs for a reasonable price. I highly recommend it as the step before going to the 70D or even the 7D."

Although I am also hankering to own a full frame camera, someday, at the moment this is what I can afford. I bought this Canon T3i to replace my old Rebel.  I love to shoot video and I wanted to upgrade to 1080P.  I also used to lug both a video and a still camera, now I don't have to.  I don't have to buy new lenses as the 3 lenses I have for the old Rebel are compatible in size.So far I have shot hundreds of videos and thousansd of stills.  I have brought it everywhere from parades, to beaches in Delaware and California, to Las Vegas, the Grand Canyon, Shenandoah mountains and to Florida. I usually just bring a monopod for better portability.  I shot indoor videos and stills, in particular, with my daughter's ballet recitals and my kids' school concerts an plays.  Using a long zoom (not with the expensive fast lenses but decent), a monopod and setting it to 1600 ISO, I can shoot hundreds of pictures and get more than a handful of great photos.To shoot videos it is recommended to use faster SD cards.  I am using 16g Transcends class 10 SD cards.  The price of memory cards have fallen so much that I could afford to buy several of them - just under $13 for the class 10 Transcends at the time of this review.  There are a few times when the video recording stops automatically after a few seconds, but usually that is when I  have used the card so many times (record, delete, record, ...etc), I just defragment that SD card and the problem stops.I uses iMovie to process my video clips.  The Canon video format import very easily.Overall, it is an excellent camera to shoot family stills and videos to preserve and record lasting memories.  The size is just right for me, it's not as big and heavy as a full frame camera."

This holiday we decided it was time to stop putting it off and we dove in.  We received the camera and immediately went out to start testing it and were very presently surprised.  The arguments that the picture quality is not good enough to justify the price increase from your run of the mill 180$ camera are easily squashed when you see what this camera can do.  It takes a bit of reading on the functionality of the camera before you can really get the best of it, but simply on the preset and automatic settings you can tell the difference.  The camera consistently gives great pictures and for a mid range DSLR camera I would defiantly recommend it.  A sturdy or manageable case is recommended as the size of cameras like this makes it more likely to be damaged if you are just carrying it around unprotected.

However since canon launched the T4i the price has dropped even further making this an even better value then it was before. This is an excellent camera if you are looking to take your photography to the next level. However it is important to note what a DSLR will and won't do for you.It Will:-Give you better looking pictures. Even just taking pictures on Auto you can get some spectacular shots.-Allow you to &#34;take off the training wheels&#34; and have full control over your pictures-Expand your shooting capabilities with lenses for every occasion.It Won't:-Automatically make all your pictures great. You still need to compose and pick your shots.-Give you the portability of a Point-and-Shoot camera.The body of the camera is very well constructed, the buttons are all easy to reach and the live view screen is great for composing and reviewing your shots. All the advanced functionality you'd expect is there, though some of it is buried deep in the options menus. However the manual clearly explains where to find everything, so if you don't know something the manual is actually helpful in most cases."

I contacted Canon for a repair and was refused an RMA, their only offer was for me to send it in at my own expense.Canon removed and apparently tossed out my LCD cover I had purchased from Amazon at the same time; they refused to replace or return it.I was a little taken aback that both as a Canon long time registered user and owner of many high end professional Canon products that Canon really felt no need to admit fault or rectify the situation.My daughter is happy to have the camera that was given to her, only to be taken away for repair, back.Having dealt with Nikon's customer service for over a decade through my job I can say that my interaction with Canon has tremendously cooled me on this company.Customer loyalty is a thing of the past and I believe brand loyalty is also on the wane.Keep your all packaging so that you can just return it to Amazon rather than deal with Canon direct or you will end up in the endless customer service loop where they just give you boilerplate and never solve anything."

Between different brands you'll see one does something better than the other. In this case, the T3i's direct competitor (Nikon D5100) is a little better with low light performance, but the T3i does video better. D5100 also seems a little more 'newbie' friendly control wise, while the T3i offers ease of access to more advanced functions. Overall though they're almost identical!I could go on all day about how this camera compares to others, but ultimately that is something you should research yourself when you're making an investment such as this! Consider the ergonomics, the interface, what you're going to use it for, your budget - so on.. Find a camera that works for you!With that, I'll continue with some pros/cons. I'm not going to list things that are available on all DSLRs though (mirror lockup, manual control, etc):Pros:- T3i's quality. The body has a high quality, durable feel to it. Nothing really feels cheap on it.- Image quality. Sharp images (sharper yet with a prime lens), good color quality, minimal lens distortion (18-55) with some minor vignetting (nothing that can't easily be fixed in post processing). The picture quality will ultimately be decided by your lens (and your photography skill).- Video. DSLRs aren't really that great with video, but the T3i offers a 'sensor crop' zoom function. Basically it'll use a small part of the sensor to record 1080p without skipping pixels on the sensor. This works well for some things but it means you're getting a 3x zoom level so your FOV is going to be very narrow, especially with a telephoto lens. This sensor crop video mode eliminates/minimizes  moire/aliasing issues typically associated with doing video on a big DSLR sensor. There's a whole lot more on this video topic for DSLRs ('Jello' effect, getting the proper shutter speed for the framerate, lighting, lens, etc), more than I can possibly include in this review. Google is your friend when learning DSLR!Cons:- Low light ISO noise.. One thing the D5100 does better than this T3i is low light iso performance. Less noise at higher ISOs. That's not saying this camera can't produce some superb night photography, but you'll be using a tripod to get those results.- Lens quality.. both the 18-55mm and 55-250mm IS II lenses are all-plastic body.. It's hard to imagine lenses that costs hundreds of dollars could feel cheap like this. The focus ring on the 18-55mm lens feels gritty and the inner body of the front lens element wobbles within the lens body. The 55-250mm is better overall, but the focus ring still doesn't feel as smooth as it could. Overall they get the job done (and quite well), but I feel kind of gypped when such an expensive (again, it's all relative) camera has such cheap lenses. You can expect to pay as much as your camera body costs (and more) for some good quality L lenses that don't have these minor setbacks.Neutral points to consider:- This is a crop-sensor camera. What that means is the sensor is 1.6 times smaller than 35mm film. This effectively multiplies your focal length by 1.6. So, with an 18mm lens you're actually getting the field of view of a ~29mm lens on a 35mm film or full-body DSLR camera. The big thing here is that with Canon's 'Nifty 50' 50mm lens, the FOV will be like an 80mm lens (narrow and not very useful inside).- Live view. While this can be very handy for getting good framing, autofocus is slow as hell in live view mode. The camera can still function quite well, however.All in all, this review may have been weighted more towards the 'Cons', but that's only because it's far easier to address shortcomings than identify things a DSLR does well at in a sea of DSLRs! This camera has everything you need to get great results if you know what you're doing. Overall the camera is superb and the shortcomings aren't remotely close to being dealbreakers. As I said early on in the review, make sure you do your own research and find a camera that works for you!Regardless of what camera you get (assuming this is your first DSLR), get a decent tripod (Amazon has an affordable Dolica Proline tripod that is great), a good 16GB+ Class 10 SDHC card and a DSLR cleaning kit. Other accessories (external flashes, nicer lenses) are quite expensive and things you shouldn't really worry about until you've learned the basics of DSLR photography."

I purchased this on a friends recommendation who does professional photography for weddings and other events and he mentioned this one as a great intro DSLR camera for the family. This camera is great for the average home user who is in the market for a really good camera. It's not quite professional grade however it does have many professional grade features. The 18 megapixel camera takes very clear quality images even when blowing them up to very large print sizes. We've printed 11X14 images and they look very sharp. I also really like the HD video feature that it has. I didn't think I would use it so it wasn't a factor when buying this camera but I'm really glad I have it for those short videos. If you need anything longer than 10 minutes you might want to consider buying an actual video camera. The only missing feature on video is the ability to autofocus while shooting the video.As far as taking pictures, autofocusing with the screen on takes a bit longer, if you use the view finder the autofocus seems to work much better and quickly. I'm not sure why this is but it's OK since the battery life is significantly better without the LCD on. We do use the LCD when taking a self portrait and it's really awesome that is swivels and rotates. It makes setting up the timer family portait really easy and saves a ton of time. I can't compare it to any other DSLR's because this is the only one I own, however it's a really good one and I would recommend it."

With my previous SLR cameras it was often a fight to get the lens out so I could use a different one.The pictures are extremely bright and clear. I love being able to use the automatic mode and them switch to manual. Both are useful for different photographic situations. I tend to prefer automatic when there's lots of action, and I don't have time to decide how to change the settings.The camera feels good in your hand. Even with the heavier lenses, it isn't difficult to hold. The IS (Iso Stabilization) feature is a blessing. I have ruined countless shots with camera shake. Thus far, I've only had one failure and that was when I tried a close up at a very long distance.I recommend this camera highly. It does everything I want it to do.

I can tell you that it gives beautiful results. Pair it up with a nice 50mm manual lens and a wide angle and you'll get gorgeous images 1080p. The colors really pop and the ISO levels are pretty sturdy until you get way too high. If you know how to use it (or learn how to use it, there are great websites out there)There are a couple of things that might be a problem, but if you are aware of them I can't imagine them being an issue. Firstly, it doesn't output to a monitor in full HD, so you're better of getting a cheap lcd viewfinder or magnifier to see more details. Second, It will only record clips that are 12 minutes in length, which really shouldn't be a problem unless you're trying to remake Touch of Evil. Lastly, the camera did start to overheat and shut down on me once, but it was out in the sun all day and I did get a warning on the screen. The camera worked fine after a little rest, however.So don't do super long takes, don't leave it in the sun, and don't use a monitor, and this baby is good to go.

As an adult I migrated into Canon SLRs and even two top of the line Nikons SLR's. Digital photography was becoming mainstream and I purchased a Panasonic and Canon pocket cameras.The images from the Canon were very reminecent of good ol' Kodachrome 25 meaning intensity and warmth color, crispness etc. So when I decided to get back into SLR land it was a choice between the T3i and the simialar Nikon.  After spending time researching the net for comparisons I chose the Canon based primarily based on image comparisons not necessarily features.  After a month with the T3i I can say that you have to read the book and experiment.  The first pictures out of the gate were nice but where was the punch? ...after reading a few chapters the depth of programs and customization of same, led me back to my Kodachrome 25 images.I continue to play with it and burning electrons in my search as I continue to learn how to get more and different effects.In a nutshell, this is one fine camera and would recommend it to anyone. There are the Nikon and Canon die-hards out there that will continue to say their brand is better than the other, but my defining characteristic is that good old K25 look and feel of my photos.From a technical standpoint the menus are well laid out and easy to understand drill downs enhanced by short menu descriptions that even a photo-tyro can understand.  Five stars Canon!"

The camera gives me several advantages: 1. Flip out LCD makes it easy to compose a shot from all kinds of angles; 2. Audio levels on cam tell me if I'm peaking when recording voice only; 3. Compact size makes it easy to mount on a small rack, then handhold and shoot, then stabilize in CS6. Final product looks like Steadicam work. Also, this cam is very reliable in all sorts of temperatures. Haven't had a single problem with it so far and I don't expect any. I owned the T2i prior to my purchase of the T3i so I knew what I was getting image wise. I would never record music audio direct to camera--I use double-system sound (AKG 220's and R16) and sync with PluralEyes in post. However, with a Rode VideoPro mic, it's fine to record voice only audio straight into camera (no JuicedLink or Beachtek). I counter the AGC argument by running all audio through Adobe's Soundbooth or Audition and strip out hiss, noise, etc. It's amazing how accurate those programs are in cleaning up audio. If you'd like to see the T2i in action, visit[...]. I'll be adding T3i footage soon."

At the time all I had was my phone and a Toshiba Camileo H30. For the start-up of my channel it wasn't bad, but doing vlogs indoors left a lot to be desired as far as quality goes and just shooting in low-light in general would be a pain. So after research and talking to a few buddies. They couldn't say enough good things about the Canon T3i, I had to reconfirm their opinion with those of 'Professionals' and long and behold almost all the reviews have really positive things to say about this camera.I bought this with a 50mm 1.8 lens and I am super happy that I did, low-light, dark nights (outdoor street lighting), indoors, outdoors it doesn't matter this camera has not let me down. This camera has a ton of buttons and modes for which I recommend reading up on if you decide to move-up from your phone or a point and shoot. After messing with it for about 2 hours I felt confident and I simply love this camera, pictures are nice and sharp, Video (can be shot in 1080p@30fps, 1080p@24, 720p@60p) comes out looking superb, Just be warned ahead of time that all the high-quality photos and videos come at the price of your memory card, especially the video aspect. It will eat up space super quick so I would recommend nothing less than a 16GB (Class 10) memory card to really have a great time with this camera.Also for those who will just buy the body as I did, this camera is classified as a 1.6 crop body, meaning that your lens will actually be a little tighter then what it says. For Example, the 50mm that I purchased really shoots at 80mm (1x50mm=50mm + .6x50mm=30 = 80mm shooting depth), which is pretty tight in spaces between 4 to 8 feet. So keep that in mind when thinking what your needs are, I think I would've been better suited with a 40mm (would shot as 64mm), but that is my fault and it does nothing to hinder the camera's performance when out in the open world.If you want to become semi-serious about your photography and HD Filming, I can't think of a better place to start. This camera has it all plus a pull-out rotatable rear 3.0 inch LCD screen which is just great thing to have for any occasion.Great Camera at a great price that will deliver great performance when capturing those moments in your life you need captured."

Some of the features are:-Quality of 1080 pixels (HD)-Manual Focus-Regular sized mount for tripod-Also a great compact cameraI have used this camera for a while now and I love it. It has great durability and great battery life. It's been dropped a couple of times and still doesn't even have a scratch. The grip is great. You can get it pretty steady without the use of a stabilizer or tripod. Some of the negative things are that sometimes it stops recording automatically. I still don't know if there is a setting to fix it but if there is, then this is one less negative about this camera. Another one is the lack of distance of the zoom, but this is easily fixed with purchasing a long lense. So I would rate this camera 10/10 because of the great quality and settings for the type of shot you want, also because of the very minimum negatives. This camera is great for people who are looking for a professional grade camera for under one thousand dollars."

It is amazing!!. I noticed the diference right away, my pictures came out way more sharp  and with beautiful vivid colors, what can i say, it is awesome. Now i feel that my lenses are working in their full capacity. I am not a professional photographer, i have been on this only for two years, and i have a long way of things to learn, and this T3I neither is a professional camera, but if your budget don't let you go for a 60D or 5D Mark or L series lenses, i totally recommend you this camera and any of the lenses i mentioned before. It is a very good and affordable option. I have my own backdrops, a flash, and i do a lot 'improvised studio sessions' and a lot of outside family and children sessions, and so far i have nothing to complaint about my 'baby' T3I. As long as you shoot in manual and know how to play with light, composition and be willing to learn and do your best, you will have great results with this camera. Hope this review help somebody. Im not too much into tech stuff, so this is more about how good this T3I have been for me. Good luck!"

Mid-range DSLR","As most reviewers have written about the T3i, its function and qualities, I shall not repeat or rehash the same material. If you already own a T2i and do not need a variable angle LCD monitor, save your money because the T3i is almost identical to its predecesor, which it is replacing. The only suggestions that I have is that you should use a fast large capacity SD card and replace the standard lens (EF-S 18-55mm) with the more versatile IS 18-135mm lens, especially when you are travelling. That is what I always use as my 'walk around' lens. My second pearl is to buy the body only (you should be able to find it for around $430-470) and get the better lens separately, and unless you need extra zoom or macro photography, the IS 18-135 lens will be all you need.If you feel that you must have the combo as advertised, look at Sam's Club.They also include a 55-250mm lens and a spacious camera bag in their package for about $860."

I was motivated enough that I bought this camera and since then (3 months or so) I have not regretted it. I love the photos I am able to take and I love the video quality as well. In fact, here is a link to the video I made on YouTube, check it out to see what an novice can do with this camera... [...]All the shots in the video are with the kit lens except the very first moon shot, I borrowed a friend's 75-300mm lens.The kit lens has been great. Sure I would love to buy a nice L-series Canon lens, but can't afford it at this time. I took some portraits over the weekend and loved the results! Here is something to try, put the focus at about 50mm, set aperture as low as possible, make sure your shutter speed is at least 1/60 for handheld (maybe be in the aperture mode so that is automatic), increase your ISO if it is darker, and take some head shots of someone. Put them up against a cool background (a brick or stone wall...) and take a few shots. Really, I have been impressed with the great photos I have been able to take.To take it to the next level also check out Photoshop Lightroom. It is an amazing program and can really help your photos stand out.Anyway, if you haven't been convinced yet from all the other reviews, this is a great camera, I have loved it, have not regretted spending the money for it, and it has brought a lot of fun to my life. I hope you decide to buy a DSLR, if not today do it soon!"

I switched from point and shoot to a bridge camera (Sony DSC HX200V) to DSLR.  I've had it for 9 months and have taken 2000+ photos with it.  It's been a great camera from the start: beautiful image rendering (not blotchy like the Sony even though they have same pixel size), really good with low light situations (I recommend using a tripod), intuitive user interface, and fairly sharp images with kit lens and the Canon 55-250mm lens.  The price for this camera is good for the quality, especially for a DSLR beginner or amateur.  I chose this over some Nikon cameras because it felt more intuitive and comfortable, especially with smaller hands.  The live view with vari-angle screen is nice.  It allowed me to take shots at awkward angles easily.  However, I don't use Live View or auto-focus often because using auto-focus and with Live View takes a long time to focus and capture images, even after I've adjusted Live View shooting modes/options.  Sometimes the camera will not capture/record the image if it can't focus.  I've missed many shots because of this.  You'll need to switch to manual focus and/or not use Live View.  The battery life is pretty good for this camera - about 350-400 images (~3 hours of shooting time).  After market batteries work just as well as Canon batteries and are way cheaper and more affordable.  The Polaroid macro filters available on Amazon are a nice and inexpensive addition to your kit (~$15).  It's allowed me to take some really nice macro shots with the kit lens and allows me to cut the minimum distance for the zoom lens (makes it much easier to shoot indoors with zoom lens).  Overall, I'm quite pleased with this camera as it's easy to use and comfortable to carry around.  I rate it a 4.5/5 stars due to the issue with Live View and auto-focus."

Struggles on the white balance a little, focus points can be unclear, shadows can be dramatic","There are plenty of incredible and far more in-depth reviews for this camera that you can read online. This one from DPReview will tell you everything you need to know, and far more than you ever wanted to know about this camera.http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/canoneos600dMy few thoughts to add to this...I bought this camera because the T2i's price had jumped since it had become discontinued, the T4i was being pushed and promoted, and as a result the prices for the T3i were being slashed in preparation for the T4i. The camera takes great pictures, and it has rich quality, it can handle a surprisingly high ISO levels.The UI is a little bit confusing, for the most part it's fairly intuitive, but tweaking some of the settings in some of the modes like aperature priority or shutterspeed priority, can be a little less then clear.Outdoors, this camera shines, and handles lighting beautifully for the most part, however, sometimes, the camera for some reason greatly emphasizes shadows depending on the angle that you're shooting at. Of course, adjusting the angle of your shot will change the way your camera deals with the light, and the way it records the light, but there are certain, very FEW, situations where the camera for some reason struggles to properly capture the light correctly and as a result the photos come out very underexposed.Sometimes on indoor shooting the camera struggles with white balance, for the most part the auto-white balance is satisfactory, but at certain points it struggles and you might it necessary to go in and tweak WB settings for the camera, it's something you should be aware of as you shoot, so as to avoid slaving over the computer fixing the WB in all of your shots.Sometimes when the camera is on autofocus, it will choose the wrong focus point, changing the camera's focus point is not exactly intuitive, quick or easy which is unfortunate and annoying. It'd be nice if the camera had a more intuitive and quick way to change the focus point for your camera instead of having to recompose your shot everytime :/But again overall, it's great. I havent really shot much video with it so I can't comment on that.... I've been shooting with a 50mm f/1.8 lens for the most part :/"

I had thought about going for broke and upgrading to the 60D or possibly waiting for the t4i, but decided against it as the t3i and 60D are, in comparison, pretty much the same. And I did not want to pay more for the t4i and have to wait for it when I could get a decently priced t3i right at the very moment that I wanted it. I am not a videographer by any means, I love playing around with the video feature but it is not that important to me. If the video is more important than check out the t4i or the 60D"

I was stuck between canon and nikon for a while, but in the end I went with canon simply because I liked the feel of it better.  Anyway, I'm in college studying photography and this camera was actually way more than I even needed.  They recommended at least a canon t3 but I wanted to get a better one so I could start some freelancing a little here and there.  It takes amazing pictures, but remember...you can get the nicest camera on the market, but it doesn't mean you'll get amazing pictures because of the camera's quality.

I was surprised that it took a different size battery because the original batteries I brought for my xsi were very expensive.  I am happy to say battery prices have dropped so much I was able to buy two batteries for less than 20% of what I paid for one,  Everything from my old camera swapped over to the T3i including my $300 flash.  I strongly urge anyone buying a camera over the internet make sure you read the customer reviews, because if it looks too good to be true IT IS too good.  Several sites advertised the Canon T3i for almost $100 less but they were scams, I started to buy it at one site but I realized that I did not review this site (I was back and forth between several site) so I stopped the ordering process and checked the site out, it was a scam and people did not get camera but was charged on their credit card.  I really take my time now due to that near miss.  Something like this I order through Amazon.com their prices are very good but most important I feel protected there.  I am not associated with Amazon in any way I just like  the sence of security from them on a big buy.  The Camera is a dream.  I love the viewer.  I did how ever did have to buy newer memory chips with a highere write speed, the picture size is Big and if you take 3-4 shots in a second you may slow down the process with the old memory cards."

I upgraded from the t1i and what a great upgrade it was.The size is great, it's relatively light and fits in my hands perfectly.The kit lens (18-55mm) is also better than to be expected. Takes pretty sharp pictures and for the price, can't get any better!The articulated swivel screen is probably my favorite part of this camera. I can close it when not using the camera and not worry about the screen getting scratched, and it really helps for getting those low shots where I normally would had to lay completely flat on my stomach. The screen itself looks beautiful, there are so many pixels so you can get a real good idea if you were in focus or not.Recently, I was considering getting a Canon G12 because I thought I would use it more, but I decided against it. Either way I have to lug a camera around. The G12 may be significantly smaller, but I won't just throw it in my purse without a case, so I might as well have my t3i with me and use my iPhone if I don't have it.Side note: for those looking to get a good CHEAP portrait lens, look at Canon's 50mm Prime f/1.8 lens. It's only about $125 and will allow you to get those great portraits that the kit lens won't."

The picture and video quality is also amazing.  I love taking video of our new born and then watching it in HD.  The swivel screen is another great option that the T2i(Older model) does not have.  Having this has been very useful for akward angle pictures during functions.  The battery life of the camera has been good I don't use the camera daily but it still maintains a good amount of charge if i got a week between use for a few weeks.  Cons for the camera are very minimal but one thing is even though the pre-set settings are very user friendly the manual settings are not so user friendly but once you get the hang of what the settings need to be for a specific shot then its not a huge deal.

I'll start by saying that it's a great still camera - no surprises really.  It's as good as the other entry level Canon's.  The 'creative' features are a little silly if you ask me, but easily ignored.Video:  The quality (using my 85mm 1.8) truly is outstanding.  Go watch some semi-pro stuff on Vimeo - this camera can hang with most stuff there.  Manual focusing is a real trick - and on that alone, I would not recommend this as a video camera for the casual videographer.  I wish there were some settings between Auto and Manual (like aperture priority, shutter priority, etc).  Full manual is simply too much work for many situations, and the full auto leaves something to be desired.  I also wish they had put more energy into the audio.  You cannot monitor the audio while recording (with either headphones or even audio levels).  A level is visible while setting the record level, but not while recording.  This oversight really puts a damper on the camera for me, and I have a hard time believing that it would really have increased the cost too much to simply add a headphone jack.I use the Rode VMP, and have had some difficulty getting the audio just right.  The onboard mic is garbage.  I have not gotten around to trying my other mics (lapel, wireless).  Get ready to spend a lot of time getting the settings just right.Still, my overall opinion of the camera is good.  I intend to use it to compliment the G10 (a terrific all around video camera).  The T3i does static shots very well (think: interviews).  The depth of field available is amazing and it performs well for artistic shots (just be prepared to spend time learning how to follow focus).  As to general video shooting and anything handheld, I'll stick to my G10.UPDATE:  I'm quickly becoming spoiled by the quality of the video on the T3i.  I find that I rarely use the G10 anymore.  The quality of the video on this DSLR is really something and I've got the VMP figured out (+20 gain on the mic, and manual audio on the camera set at 8 or 9 clicks above zero).  I also shoot exclusively in 24p.  On the T3i, this is amazing.  I do find that I'm switching back and forth between a 1.4 30mm and the 1.8 85mm a lot (it's way harder to just move back and forth with video than with stills).  Still, it's all about the prime lens with this camera.  I'd recommend at least getting a cheap 1.8 50mm."

It's not a sealed body like the 7d, but if you care for it as you should anyway, that shouldn't be an issue. The only problem, which for us is HUGE, is that it will drain batteries within a few days when sitting OFF in a camera bag or on the shelf. It seems to use a huge amount of power when off. Called Canon and they said, 'yes, they can do that,' like, 'so? did you have any other stupid questions?' Our 7D and even the 60D never did that. The two Elph 300 camera's we use for quick shots of sets and what not will last MONTHS on a battery just sitting in an un-used state in the camera. This T3i will drain batteries if they are left in a camera body whether or not it's on, so we have to store batteries outside the camera. Which means it's no good for news or run and gun stuff. We're selling it and going to something else since we can't have a camera that drains a brand-new, fully charged Canon battery in three days while sitting on the shelf or that we have to find the battery to install it to take a quick shot."

Every photographer I know and respect has a Canon in their hand so I knew there had to be a reason.Right out of the box, this takes amazing photos! It's done surprisingly well even in low lighting without a flash. I've had very few blurry shots and the few that I did have were when the subject moved abruptly.So far I've just been using the auto settings, but this weekend I plan to read the booklet that came with it and really learn about the manual controls. With that said, if you're a beginner, I think you'll be impressed at how well the auto controls do for every day shooting.The HD video exceeded my expectations. Just know in advance that this is not intended to be a full fledged camcorder. If your video becomes too long, the camera will overheat and it will stop recording. This is what I've read any way. I haven't shot any video longer than a few minutes, so I haven't been able to test this theory. But I do understand I can't expect a DSLR to do what a camcorder does because they don't have the same mechanics. Still this camera is more than sufficient for short video clips and the clarity is very nice. It's much better than carrying around a DSLR and a camcorder on vacation!Just make sure your SDHC card has the number 6 or higher on it. The sales person didn't explain that to me and I got a card with a 4 on it. 4 is too slow for recording HD video. The camera will automatically stop recording after a few seconds.I'm in love with this camera so far and look forward to learning more about its features! The swivel screen is worth the extra money too. It really makes a difference and the colors are very accurate. The screen has a non-glare and smudge resistant finish which helps a lot.As far as construction, the location of the menu button is strange. It's on the left, and as a right handed person, it always feels out of reach. Everything else is being controlled with my right hand and it feels awkward when I have to control the menu with my left.A few people have mentioned the grip of the camera body. I do understand that. When I'm holding it, I always feel like I'm about to drop it. Not sure what to say about that. Just be sure to wear the strap that comes with the camera! :)UPDATE 6/19/12 - I've found the manual focus to be a bit of a pain for video. I am constantly refocusing my subjects and it makes a very loud sound on the video when I do it. This is my first HD camera, so I have no idea if this is common. I did read reviews for other cameras with auto-focus on video and customers often complained that the auto-focus did a poor job and they went back to manual. So I honestly have no idea if auto would be any better. Most people say manual is the way to go.When the subject is in focus, the quality is breathtaking. It's just getting there that seems to be an uphill battle."

I use the various quick settings on the dial and go, this camera takes amazing pictures.  I previously owned a Digital Rebel XT which was great as well, but this is far better for a few reasons.  First it is faster to start, it has the adjustable LCD viewfinder, and most importantly shoots HD video.  The video quality is ridiculously good as well AND I only need to carry and operate one camera now.I replaced the kit lens with an EF-S 18-135mm and 55-250mm and with my tripod can take just about any shot and video even at his baseball games.  Combine a battery grip and 32GB memory card and I can get through an entire tournament shooting a ton of pictures and short videos.I bought a killer camera like this BECAUSE I am not a photographer and it allows me to take great pictures and video.I highly recommend this camera to anyone in a similar situation, it has paid for itself many times over already."

I really did.When it functioned correctly, it took some very good photos. However, for video; this thing is sadly lacking. For one thing, it would constantly overheat; even when being used in an air conditioned space. It could never record more than 6-8 minutes of 1080 video  without overheating. Attempted to record a school concert, what recordings were obtained; were awful.Images taken, quickly become grainy when the light is anything less than optimum.From my viewpoint, the menu system is too cumbersome. With large hands, it was difficult to hold and use the camera. It was awkward to access the various wheels and buttons.The screen was difficult to view while outside. ANY glare rendered it completely useless. Used inside, you have to shift your head or screen to find the right angle for viewing. Even then it was often hard to read.Barreling was noted in some test images. An image with a flag pole against a bright blue and slightly cloudy sky turned the flagpole  into an arc rather than straight line.The auto focus would function adequately for pictures, but only with absolutely optimum lighting. When you shoot video; you could never get the image crisp using either auto or manual focus. Even when you mange to get the subject crisp, any panning quickly resulted in blurred and/or soft images. If you prefer to shoot video with all in focus, forget about the included 18 - 55 mm lens. It was painful to try and manually focus this lens and of course the auto focus never worked correctly.It's probable the unit tested was defective. But unwilling to risk an exchange, the camera was promptly returned for refund.I've generally had satisfactory experiences with canon products, however; this one failed to meet my needs, expectations and preferences. My advice would be to try before purchasing. This one could quickly turn into an expensive mistake."

The pros and cons of which I would not go into because the fact remains in the ultimate choice of a person and in the finances they have at their disposal sine both these brands have similar features with '+s and -s' in their own distinctive categories over which they have ruled and still improving on respectively.What I can say from my interaction and use of the camera has improved my photos tremendously and this is mostly in part to the extended and fully capable feature set of this camera. It has been a great introductory DSLR experience for me and this is what I can base my recommendation on and it has only served to improved my thirst for creating better images which has led me to researching materials and training videos to get my skill set up to scratch.I bought the camera with the standard EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS lens and it is a great learning lens for beginners I can definitely see myself progressing to other high-powered lens as I immerse further into the DSLR world and image photography. All with the ultimate goal of transforming what the eyes see on a daily basis into photography, capturing the moment in time and translating it into a story that can be felt by many through their own eyes.I will definitely recommend this camera to those who want to take the bold leap into the DSLR photography world, I can assure you that you will be amazed...."

The only reason why I am giving this 4 stars instead of 5 is because the movie mode has 1 major flaw like most dslr cameras do.

I also wanted a lens with enough range that I don't have to switch lenses as often.The T3i is nice, a little more complicated than the XT. I would prefer that it does NOT take video but that isn't an option.My only complaints about the T3i is that the power switch is in the same place as before, and so I still may accidentally move the mode dial when turning it on/off, which can result in improperly exposed pictures. Also, I still haven't figured out the best settings for the autofocus, it still seems sort of hit-or-miss.The T3i body worked fine with my other Canon lenses.However, this kit had an 18-135mm lens that seemed to work fine. But then when I looked at the images on my computer, the focus is soft. When I zoomed in to Actual Pixels view in Photoshop, the images are not crisp.

The T3i bundled  software on the DVD will NOT run on an older Powermac, such as the G5's, which a LOT of us still use. Now, to use the T3i, an Intel powered Mac is required. What are they thinking?The software from the older Canon XTi for example, runs fine on a Powermac so you can use the 'Live View' function while shooting live in a light-box. Before you point out that there is a 'Live View' button on the T3i, let me just say there is no comparison looking at an image on a 24' inch screen.So the fix is to go with an inexpensive Window PC with XP Pro instead of investing in any more Macs and use the PC as a stand-alone station with the light-box. The cost comparison is astounding.Jesse"

I own both the D60 and D600 and this camera wins.-The D60 is far heavier, but the construction is exactly the same (same plastic/rubber). There's no justification for the added weight. Seriously canon, why is it so heavy? It's the same sensor and software.-The larger LCD is useless since you'll be mounting an LCD viewfinder on top anyway.-$300 price is totally not justified. Save the money for lenses or other gear.-The camera can shoot at 5.7fps (vs 3.1 on the D600), only useful for still photographers. Also, it can shoot at 1/8000 vs 1/4000, again, useless for film.I think most people who buy this camera are doing so purely because they believe it looks and feels more professional, they don't really understand it's the same hardware. My advice is either step up to a full frame body, or buy the T3I. The D60 is an odd one in the lineup, not sure what canon was thinking. They're charging 40% more for added weight.When someone talks about shooting film with a D60, I don't think 'professional'.  I think 'you don't really understand your camera.'"

I am a tall guy (6'3') and the swivel screen is perfect for positioning the camera down and around in positions to get the best shot.

The pictures i got on the 'no flash' setting at sunset and nighttime in downtown Frankfurt will probably stick with me forever. The video is also rather easy to use and provides some good quality. Just need to focus as you go at times.

I will note, however, some issues I have run into so you are aware they exist and plan accordingly.MOVIE MAKINGSome people (myself included) get this camera for the ability to shoot 24p, 30p and 60p movies through a large lens into a large sensor, which in the world of pro video cameras would cost you many times more, all the above being equal.POWEROne thing I would like to tell you from the start is that if you get a 6 battery add-on power pack for this camera, plan to use it for photos only. For movies, you will go through a battery magazine in a few minutes!Find the AC adapter to use the camera straight from wall power for movies. Such an adapter is available right here on Amazon to buy separately and it will save you lots of frustration, recharge waiting time and battery costs.FLASH (for photos)The MK off-camera remote flashes are well worth the investment, because they will give you the ability to capture amazing photos by experimenting with lighting, color, exposure and shadows.ENHANCEMENTSYou will focus manually when shooting movies with a DSLR, but that is OK because you want to use this camera especially for movie effects such as close-ups or dialogues while pulling focus. A follow-focus device will help here. They range from a few hundred dollars to a plastic strip with a handle on eBay for $14, and an upcoming '$50 follow focus' Hondo Garage project to be released soon. All the above devices other than the eBay cheap solution will require a $120-300 rig. To make your rig look impressive (if you film for clients) and to enhance your movie making ability, add a matte box that holds filters or at least one that works as a shade.Zebra stripes, HDR, more control, etcOne gray market utility that greatly enhances photo shooting and movie making is a firmware sidegrade called Magic Lantern. I've used it with no glitches.Tripod, dollyThink Ravelli and Peartree, both available here on Amazon.Lights and studio backdropsYou will want a perfect white, black and green background, and the key to success is good and ample lighting. Neweer and Cowboy Studio among others, here on Amazon.By now you're realizing that making movies on a Canon Rebel T3i is neither cheap nor hassle free. However, it beats spending $15,000 for a cinema camera that needs $600 storage media and a $3000 lens.The lens included in this kit (18-55mm) is excellent for most purposes, and appears to be a favorite for making movies. In pictures it has a slight corner distortion at the widest angle setting, which may go unnoticed unless someone's face happens to be there. Overall, considering the awesome savings and the ability to work like a movie director without a Holywood budget, highly, highly recommended.TIPIf you use another camera to capture other parts of your movie, and the T3i just for the high quality portions (close-ups, pulling focus, dialogues, faces, etc) then make sure you shoot at the same frame rate or close (if your other camera is 29.97 / 60i then use this camera at 30p (closest setting) and interpolate the footage from the other one so both are progressive before combining them. Also do a white balance on both cameras right before shooting.TWEAKINGThis Canon (with minor adjustments and a little patience) can match footage shot on most other cameras if you need to work with 2 cameras; at least it matches my Canon and Panasonic pro video cameras close enough so people can't tell that two or more completely different cameras were used.CONCLUSIONExcellent deal for photographers; a godsent for indie movie makers."

I already had a Nikon D5100 and love it. I needed a second camera for moviemaking and decided to try the EOS Rebel T3i, so I bought one and have been using it for a couple of months alongside the Nikon. It's okay for full-motion HD video, with somewhat more control over exposure than the Nikon.For still photography, it sucks. One of the motivations for a DSLR instead of a pocket digital camera is the expectation that the DSLR will take the picture when you press the button. The Canon T3i doesn't. The Nikon always does. This difference is infuriating. Any decent photographer knows when to take the picture. If the camera waits a couple of milliseconds--or full seconds, in the case of the Canon T3i--you can't capture the moment.It's also cheaply made, compared with the Nikon--all kinds of minor shortcuts to reduce the cost.I'm not sorry I bought it, but I am more than a little disappointed and will use the Nikon as my primary camera, with the Canon as a backup for movies, and leave it in the camera bag when I am shooting stills."

The quality is superb and low-lighting is a breeze (as soon as you get used to working the correct settings).The main reason I chose the T3i was for the 1080p video is offers. The video quality is great, but there are a few things to be aware of.1) You'll want to get a memory card rated at a 10 for speed, and make sure it's a good-quality brand. If you scrimp on the card you'll forever be hitting yourself when the video recording repeatedly stops for no apparent reason. I have been through three cards that don't cut it (three different brands). Make sure you shell out the money for a quality card or you won't be able to record the data fast enough for 1080p (particularly in bright lighting or when you have a light source in the background--like a TV or lamp).2) The camera does not auto-focus while recording video which can be really annoying. If you do any panning or zooming you will find yourself constantly toggling the manual focus on your lenses. Most DSLRs are the same, but I made an unwise assumption that this one would be different since they seemed to solve many of the conventional video problems DSLRs have.3) If you use an external video monitor while shooting video, plan on 480i resolution. The second you push the record button on the camera, the 1080p output signal changes to 480i (DVD quality video) instead of 1080p (High Def). This is not a problem at all if you don't use an external monitor, but is really annoying if you do.4) Sound quality from the built-in mic is not good. I use external mics, so this is not an issue for me, but if you depend on the built-in mic for your audio you might find yourself sorely disappointed. Still, it does okay for home video in a pinch, but for professional-quality video you'll want to purchase an external mic.All-in-all, this is a fantastic camera for still photos and a great camera for video quality/clarity. It is a little weak on the video recording features, but...what can we expect from a DSLR, right?I would definitely recommend this camera for anyone in the market for a camera in this price range. If I had a little extra to spend for a DSLR I would recommend a Canon 7D. If I were to purchase solely for video I would recommend a Canon HF G10. Yeah, I'm a Canon fan. Canon makes good quality optics without too many proprietary accessories (like Sony)."

Even when I see people with 7D's and 5DMKII's, I am still thoroughly happy with this camera. I even wrote some articles on my blog about it.Why I like it:1 - light-weight... yes, most pros will decry the plastic body, but for me, I've begun to see this as a plus. The camera is a lot lighter than the Canon metal bodied cameras, and has survived a couple nasty falls with no damage. I try to shoot with a tripod as much as possible, but most of the time, I just don't have time to mess with a tripod - the lighter weight helps.2 - Specs are more than just 'good enough'... the specs, when lined up with the 7D are still quite impressive. The only real trade-offs are slightly slower bursts, and a few less focus points. Sensor sizes are nearly identical, and they share the same processor - leading me to believe the t3i's slightly lowered specs are artificial software limits.3 - It's versatile... it does great for both video and stills, even boasting a few better features not found on the 7D (or even 5DMKII for that matter). Also, if you are bold enough to try the Magic Lantern firmware add-on you really get your money's worth - especially for video."

Having multiple lens options that are affordable in a more compact design makes the DSLR video world very appealing. The T3i is a really nice entry level DSLR, but for video use, there are few problems.The 'HDMI Out' when router thru the camera is not really 1920x1080, as described. It's more like 1620x. And when you press record on the camera, the HDMI Out drops its signal even more, to Standard Definition. For us, this is a major issue. If your workflow only requires you to record internally to your SD card, and you're totally content having your original footage saved as an h.264 file, this isn't a problem. In addition, a few Canon DSLRs (and maybe others) have a well-known limited record time, approximately 10 minutes before overheating then shutting down. To reduce compression and loss of color, and to increase our record time, we planned to use the HDMI Out and save our footage to an external recorder in a better format. We were unpleasantly surprised to find that this cannot be done. Limitations such as these should be boldly disclosed in Canons documentation. Again, the T3i is a wonderful little DSLR and prefect for what DSLRs in its class were traditionally designed to do; capture great still photography images."

I previously owned a 40D and was very happy with it. There were some back focusing issues but Canon had recalibrated it and it was working great. One day, though, when I was trying to photograph a painting with some very saturated reds, I noticed the camera just couldn't handle this spectrum of colors--they were strangely murky and smeared looking, lacking crisp details. I wondered if perhaps some of the newer cameras could handle reds better.I then looked at the review for the T3i on dpreview. They test all their reviewed cameras at varying ISO's with an elaborate studio still life; the results can be seen at the end of each review on a page called 'Studio scene comparison (RAW)'. You can view the images at full resolution and compare sections shot with many different cameras. There are several small bright red fuzzy balls in the still life that are excellent measures for red. I noticed with interest that most cameras (including the 1D!) did not capture the reds well--they had the same murkiness that I noticed with my 40D. There were, however, a few notable exceptions, including Canon's T3i, 60D and 5D Mark II; and Nikon's D3. The red fuzzy balls shot with these had well-defined, clear details, without the problems other cameras suffered from. The 60D, unfortunately, had an orange cast in its reds, leaving the T3i the undisputed winner among lower priced models. Please note: most reviews claim that all the Canon 18 mp cameras have the same sensor--this comparison seems to indicate that they have redesigned or tweaked it for these most recent models.I purchased the T3i and, because of past problems, carefully tested its focusing accuracy. I ended up exchanging the first one because it seemed a bit sluggish, although it was accurate. This was a big mistake! The second one was accurate in the outside points, but back focused in the center point. I exchanged this one and ended up with one that had an accurate center point but back focused with the outside points! This is a fairly minor problem--it's off by about 1/8'. Targeted details are on the edge of the zone of sharpness rather than the center, and it's only noticeable in critical close-up shots with the aperture wide open. Still, it could be a problem for portrait and macro shots. I kept it but may send it in to be calibrated.Aside from this, it's a great camera. Beautiful, detailed images, great dynamic range, and the extra resolution gives me room to crop. The high ISO image quality is infinitely superior to the 40D.I also enjoy playing with the video function, with one disappointment: the digital zoom starts at a 3X magnification and goes up to 10X. That means you cannot shoot without any magnification when the camera is switched to digital zoom, a limitation which demands considerable room to back up from your subject. I don't know why Canon designed the zoom like this; it renders a potentially wonderful feature almost useless in an average indoor setting."

It has almost all the features of the 60D minus the bigger viewfinder, faster shooting rate, and extra cross type focus points.  I would make sure the smaller size of this camera fits your hand well.  If it is too small then you might as well get the 60D instead of this version, but if you like the feel then save some money and get the T3i."

I bought this EOS T3i after using my EOS 350D for 7 years.  Although this camera shares the same base with 350 D, it has some critical 'update' that I find important; - T3i sensor works definitely fine and 18mp image quality is quite successful. I had a chance to try 60D before and I can say that image quality of the picture taken by these two cameras are almost same. If you support with good lenses, you can have high quality images with T3i body. - The movable LCD screen is far my favorite. It gives a pleasure when you use the camera. In fact I feel like I  am playing a new toy. - The IS system on lenses works fine. I have several picture taken in low light, but they are quite sharp.Other than that, it is a very great DSLR...I have not try the video option but I am sure it gives satisfying results."

The menu is easy to navigate, I have always been able to find everything I need within a few seconds.  So far, it has been a very user-friendly camera in basically every way.The kit lens is great for the price.  If you are looking for a good beginner camera and plan on buying 2 or 3 lenses to start with, then I would recommend it.  Being a beginner myself, I was looking for one lens to use for several weeks before buying another.  The lens is great and performs exactly as described, but I soon felt very limited as far as aperture goes.  To other beginners looking for a single lens, I might recommend the 50mm f/1.8.  Otherwise, this lens has been great to have on hand and I have learned a lot using it.This camera/lens is by far one of the best investments I have made!"

T3i is a really good camera for the price and for what it is. For film this camera is awesome, it has option for an external mic and I would recommend this model over the T2i because of the swivel screen but also for the manual audio controls. The T3i is definitely modeled more for film than the T2i. I heard T2i does well if you get magic Lantern but I didn't want to have to hack my camera software to get the benefits of audio controls that the T3i already has built in. The T3i gives plenty of options for filming it has 1080p 24p, or 720p 60p, and some others that I wasn't interested in. I just care about the film look and some higher frame per seconds to do some super nice slow motion. The benefits of filming with the T3i is that you can interchange the lens and really add more to your cinematography. The only downside to the camera when it comes to filming is that there is about a 12-15 min cap on how long you can film one continuous clip in Full HD, if the clip exceeds 4 gb in size the camera will automatically stop recording, although recording back to back is not a problem, just an inconvenience that make camcorders still the leading cameras for broadcasting. This camera is not ideal for filming events but good for making narratives. The quality is amazing and has convenient controls to change shutter speeds and aperture and ISO. For filming this camera is superior to its Nikon competitor Nikon D3100. For Photography this camera does pretty well, its 18 mp picks up clear and crisp pictures it has a ISO range from 100-6400, but beware that ISO 3200-6400 the pictures have considerable noise. It shoots 3.7 pictures per sec and has a max shutter of 1/1000 not bad a little less than the 60D and 7D but it shares the same sensor as them, it is a great camera if you're learning photography or wanting to get into video. Easy to use has a good interface and comfortable grip. and sturdy build."

Tilt/flip LCD Screen is very handy and this allows you to even take pictures of yourself. The upper priced DSLR Canon models lack this feature. This is all the camera your amateur photographer will ever need. It feels light and is well balanced in your hands. If you want better quality pictures than the provided kit lens gives you, go buy yourself a Canon L lens for this T3i body. Buying a better body is not the answer to better pictures. It is like stereo equipment, the quality of the Stereo PreAmp/Amp  can only audibly improve the sound just so much. Having overkill amp power and statistical levels of inaudible  distortion, that the ear cannot hear in the first place, does not improve sound quality. The 'SPEAKERS' are the only part of the system that can do that. So here too, it is the 'LENS' that really makes the difference in 'PICTURE QUALITY' and not the camera bodies that have overkill features not necessary for 99.99% of camera users. Don't waste your money on those bells and whistles, buy yourself a better lens instead.The T3i is a great camera body and the 55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS kit lens is not bad either for the money."

The kit lens the T3i comes with (EF-S 18-55 f/3.5-5.6 IS) is fine for a while but if you take a lot of pictures you might notice that it can give you soft pictures at the telephoto end.

It only offers a few filter options, including Toy Camera, Fisheye (which a lens is better anyway), Black and white.  I have read reviews and have heard that Canon's have more 'noise' in the pictures, so hopefully I do not notice this.  I know sometimes my Pentax can cast a slight grey tint to it, I'm hoping with a Canon I do not have this conflict.  I purchased this camera to escape my comfortzone from my Pentax addiction, but I'm pretty sure in most cases I will use my Pentax.  Once I take a test run, I will further update, and I'm only judging by the software that is on the camera I am not impressed.

I bought the body only, then got a Canon 28-105 lens seperately. I recently purchased a 50mm f/1.8 lens as well.The camera is very easy to learn how to use. I watched some videos on youtube and skimmed the manual online while I was waiting for it to come in the mail (I ordered it from a different site around New Year's, so I had about a week and a half wait from when I ordered it) and as soon as I got it, charged the battery and started using it. Before this, I was using my video camera or old point and shoot for stills, but I have used a couple of other people's DSLRs (on auto mode). I've been using this exclusively in manual mode so far and it took a little bit the first day to get used to picking the right exposure settings, but once I got used to it, it's not bad. This camera takes really great photos.Other good things are: compared to my Canon Vixia HF200 (video camera), the battery seems to last a comparable length with video and the recording rate is somewhere around 5.5 mb/s with the T3i, where it goes up to 24mb/s (I believe) on the HF200, so the videos don't take up as much room on the memory card or my computer, but they look better because of the lenses and, I assume, the proccessing. The audio is surprisingly good too. I shoot videos at shows occasionaly(**Youtube search username chunkvideos and look at the Pianos Become The Teeth videos for the best example**), I manually adjusted the audio level to the lowest possible level (it indicated clipping otherwise) and the video actually sounds really good. That being said, when you're not in a loud environment, the internal mic picks up all of the camera and handling noises, so the fact that it has a mic input jack will come in handy in getting better audio.The autofocus works good sometimes. I'm trying to mostly use manual focus unless I'm taking a photo of my puppy running around the yard or something with similar action (which is also hard to autofocus on, btw). I used autofocus the first few days and it wouldn't always focus where I wanted it to (it'd focus on my puppy's nose or toys instead of her eyes, etc). I know there is a way to select focus points, but I'd rather just do it manually, plus it doesn't have full time autofocus while shooting video. Autofocusing on video does not look or sound good with this camera.I haven't used the vari-angle screen as much as I thought I would yet, but even without using it for different angles, it's pretty convenient. I like that I can store it with the screen facing towards the camera body, so it's protected. I also like that when I have it flipped out to the side, my nose isn't against the screen and there is a little extra room for my face when I'm looking through the viewfinder. I have tried 'self portraits' with it (in quotes because half of them were just me pointing the camera at my face), but it's hard to do without a tripod because neither of my lenses will focus closer than 18'. It's kind of hard with a tripod too, because of focusing before you get to where you're going to stand (again, autofocus wouldn't focus on my face).Continuous shooting and exposure bracketing are really nice features. I also like that you can do both with a timer. Exposure bracketing is something that I overlooked when I was researching camera options, because I didn't know what it was. You can quickly and easily set your camera to take 3 continuous photos with the same aperature, but at different shutter speeds, so it produces an under exposed, normally exposed, and over exposed version of the same shot (assuming you use a tripod or hold the camera really still) and if you use software that can merge the three images into one, you can create an image that shows details in the dark, light, and medium areas of the photo. For instance, in a normal photo of a sunset, the sun would be bright and anything like trees or buildings in the foreground would be dark, merging would allow you to see details in the foreground too.Pros:-Photo quality-Manual settings-Ease of use-Manual focus-Low noise-Good low light shots-1080p video with good quality-Manual settings for video-Vari-angle screen-Mic input jack-Manual audio levels-Small file sizes for HD video-Not too big or heavy-The flash doesn't pop up in manual mode (it hasn't for me anyway)-It actually comes with usable software (I've been doing all of my photo editing with the included software, I think it's called Digital Photo Professional)-It can store camera and lens setting information on your photos (not literally on them, but in the file information)-Continuous shooting works nicely-Exposure bracketing is a cool feature which allows you to edit high dynamic range photos-Able to use a timer and choose how many shots you want the camera to take and if you want it to be exposure bracketed or notCons:-Autofocus hasn't worked well for me-Cropped sensor makes it hard to get wide angle shots without spending a lot on a nice lensUpdate: I've gotten some better lenses since writing this review and the autofocus issue seems to have had to do with the lenses and not the camera."

It is, in my opinion, one of the toughest things to shoot (and I've taken almost 30,000 pictures since I got my first digital camera in 2004)--low light, no ability to use flash, high speed, from a distance and people frequently walking in front of the subject. Unfortunately, this camera could not get the job done. The issue was the autofocus. I tested the sports setting, resetting aperature and shutter speed, and various focus settings. I just could not get a clear picture...and I shot almost 1400 before returning the camera. I opted for the Sony a55 and couldn't be happier! Crystal clear action shots with vivid color on the first try. I used a tamron 2.8, 70-200 lens & a tripod for both cameras so the only thing I can attribute the difference to is the camera itself. So, to sum it up...if you are only taking still pictures, the canon is fine BUT if you are shooting any movement at all, get the Sony."

On YouTube search '2012 T3i Best DSLR'Okay, now let's take a fresh look at the Canon EOS Rebel T3i (600D) DSLR and compare it to the 60D and T2i. In this review I'll also talk about some 'MUST HAVE' accessories for this camera.The Canon EOS Rebel T3i DSLR was release in March of 2011 and has quickly become one of the most popular DSLRs available.As if the Rebel line wasn't popular enough with budding photographers... The introduction of the T3i has captured the imagination of thousands of aspiring videographers... with it's ability to capture FULL HD video... bright, articulating 3 inch LCD screen (which comes in really handy when shooting video in the field), and the ability to select from a host of lenses... which is common to DSLRs in general.Professionals prefer DSLRs because they allow for an accurate preview of what they are shooting, at the moment they push the shutter button. DSLRs also have larger sensors than compact point-and-shoot digital cameras (which means a better quality and high-resolution image)...Full HD video and interchangeability of lenses are particularly attractive to wannbe videographers (especially in a sub-$1000 DSLR... like the T3i)... because NOW they can shoot amazing HD video footage for a fraction of the what it would have cost... just a few years ago... PLUS they end up with a great camera for still photography...The Canon T3i (600D) ships with the body, battery, battery charger, USB interface cable, AV cable, EOS solution disk (that contains the really handy EOS utility - I'll talk about this a bit more later...) and a suitable strap (although I quickly replaced mine). AND if you desire... a kit lens...The T3i is considered a compact DSLR at 5.2 inches wide, 3.9 inches high and 3.1 inches deep (not including a lens)... compared to the larger and more expensive 60D at 5.69 inches wide, 4.17 inches high and 3.09 inches deep.The T3i is very similar in size, weight and features to the less expensive T2i. The T3i feels solid and well made and is comfortable in the hand...But I do have smaller hands... So if your hands are larger you may want to look to the 60D OR grab the Zeikos battery, power grip... for your T3i...with an additional battery...This battery grip doubles the amount of shooting you can do between battery changes AND provides a much large grip surface.At the heart of the Canon T3i is an 18 megapixel CMOS digital sensor and the DIGIC 4 processor. This sensor and processor are also found in Canon's 60D and T2i.The camera has one SD card slot that can take a regular SD, SDHC or SDXC card... The T3i does not ship with a card. So plan on adding that to your your list.I highly recommend using nothing less than a class 10 SDHC card for with this camera, especially if you want to shoot HD video.  Even if you don't, you'll want a fast card when shooting continuous photos at 18 mega pixels. I personally like 32 GB cards because they are pretty cheap now and give you enough room to shoot photos all day. Plus 32 giga bites is large enough to hold almost 2 hours of HD video.The T3i has what Canon calls 'Live View Shooting'...which provides a very accurate simulation of photos and video using the LCD screen... This is especially helpful when doing a video shoot without a separate field monitor.The 3 inch variable angle LCD monitor is bright enough for shooting in full sun... and can be flipped so that if lays flat against the camera back or can be positioned at various angles for high and low shooting.But remember... as with any camera-powered monitor, it will consume your batteries faster when you are using it. Brightness also effects battery consumption (which can be adjusted in the camera's setup menu). That being said, the flip and twist capabilities of this monitor make it a priceless asset for videographers and creative photographers.One of the major differences between the T3i and the 60D is it's continuous shooting speed of 3.7 frames per second verse the 60Ds 5.3 frames per second.For me, this was not an issue as I purchased my T3i primarily for shooting video. But if you like to shoot action, you may want to consider the 60D.The controls of the T3i are easy to access with the thumb and four finger.  And are pretty easy to master with little effort... I do suggest keeping the manual near as it will prove a valuable asset and will save frustration as your skills progress.One thing that really impressed about this camera was a real world example of how easy it is for a beginner to get professional results, with this camera... out of the box.One day my son... who has never used a DSLR camera before, went on a walk with my new T3i. When he came back I could tell from his face that he experienced something really special. His big smile made me very curious to see his photos.I was amazed at the stunning images this camera enabled him to capture... as he simply used the camera's scene 'intelligent auto mode' and the dial-selectable 'creative zone modes.'When you select a different dial mode, the camera shows a short and helpful description of that mode. This feature can accelerate your progress and help to quickly hone in on a mode that is best suited for the type of shooting you are doing.My son's experience helped me realize what a fantastic job Canon did skinning over this formidable professional-level camera... with a simple and easy to use point-and-shoot-like interface... that enables the novice (like my son) to achieve very satisfying results.I am convinced that results are one of the reasons that owners rate this camera MUCH higher (close to 5 out of 5 stars) than professional reviewers who usually rate this camera at less than 4 out of 5 starts... and tend to nit pick about technical details and specifications.I'm not saying that specs are not important... but what I am saying is that, at the end of the day... all that matters is that you have good quality photos and videos to show for your effort, regardless of your experience level.The T3i allows you to easily select and scroll between ISO 100 (for well-lit scenes) to ISO 6400 for lower lighting scenarios.Photo quality generally looks great up through ISO 800 and begins to show some small signs of degradation from ISO 1,600 on.The little scrolling wheel toward the front of the camera makes selection of a variety of functions... including ISO... really easy.The 9-pt autofocus systems is accurate and quick for photos... but does struggle in very low light situations.The T3i camera does have the ability to autofocus while you are shooting video... but often takes a few seconds to refocus focus...Plus the noise of the camera while focusing.... will likely be heard in your video. You will also find that the battery life will deplete rapidly when autofocusing a lot during a video.All this being said, the T3i's video autofocus is pretty useless. Fortunately there are plenty of other great reasons to like this camera...As with most cameras these days the T3i includes optical image stabilization that works well... with off-hand shooting.The T3is battery life is generally good... however, battery life is so subjective and is very dependent on how you shoot, the brightness of your LCD screen...  and things like... whether you are using autofocus or not...For shooting photos, I have found the battery life to be excellent allowing me to take 400 to 600 shots before needed a change.Shooting video will consume your batteries at a much more rapid rate if you are using the camera's LCD screen to monitor your video.So I would recommend that you pick up a few additional batteries. I have found a very inexpensive, after-market brand... that have proven to be just as reliable as the OEM battery that came with this camera. See my YouTube Review for more info on the accessories that I mention in this review...And if you want to seriously extend the battery life of this camera (which is especially useful on location during a video shoot)... you should pick up the Zeikos Battery Power Grip for this camera that I mentioned earlier.This is a high quality accessory that matches the camera in look and feel in every way and is less pricy than Canon's version.It easily and securely attaches to the camera and has a removable tray that allows you to power the camera with 2 batteries instead of one.This grip also comes with an additional tray that allows you to use 6 double A batteries to power the camera in a pinch. This is a great safety net for those involved in remote shooting... away from a power source.If you don't want to be limited by batteries, Canon offers a DC power unit. There is a battery sized coupler that you simply insert into the battery port to power the camera by plugging it into a wall outlet.For this accessory, I would only recommend the Canon brand.One nice feature for those who wear corrective lenses (like me)... is the quality dioptric adjustment knob for the camera view finder.This knob allows for plus and minus adjustments to ensure that you see things clearly through the view finder. Although this feature is common in many DSLRs... I was glad to find out that the T3i had it after the fact...The T3i has a built-in mono microphone that sounds pretty good for general video shooting and includes an effective wind filter that can be toggled on and off in the camera's setup.However, for serious video production I recommend that you use a quality external microphone to capture your audio. I use a Zoom H4N for a large range of purposes and really affordable Audio Technica lapel mics for shooting interviews and promotional videos. A Rode shotgun mic is another that you may want to consider.On the side of the T3i there is a 1/8 inch stereo mic input. With the appropriate adapters you can send audio from 2 different mics directly into the camera's left and right channels. The camera allows you for manual adjustment of the record levels which is very useful.There are several other camera ports which include... A remote control terminal. I picked up a very affordable timer remote that I use often for time lapse videos and low light situations.There's digital audio / video out terminal and a mini HDMI out terminal this is great for using an external field monitor or hooking your camera up to your HD TV.The SD card slot is on the other side and the battery compartment in easily accessible on the bottom of the camera.When it comes to video the T3i really shines. It offers full HD video at 1920 by 1080 pixels at 30, 25 and 24 frames per second... on the high end... and also offers 1280 x 720 pixels at 60 frames per second (which is nice for slow motion) as well as 640 x 480 at 30 frames per second.You can get exceptional results from this camera with a little attention to detail and by experimenting with the automatic and manual video settings... and by trying different lenses.For low lighting situations, you may want to consider picking up a Canon 50mm F1.8 lens. It's been dubbed 'plastic magic' because it captures surprisingly good quality photos and video for a a lens with a street price that hovers around $100.The T3i also offers a 3x and 10x digital zoom that produces amazingly crisp video in movie mode.The camera also has a new video snapshot feature that takes short clips of video and stitches them together. It's a fun feature for walking around town and shooting short video clips or having some fun at a party.There's one VERY important aspect of shooting video with most DSLRs, and in our case, the T3i that you should be aware of.To protect the camera from internal heat generated when shooting video... the T3i will stop recording video when the file size of a single movie clip reaches 4GB.This means that if you are shooting in FULL HD that your maximum record time will be  around 10 to 14 minutes. This can be a bit annoying yet, it's easy enough to restart the video.... and if you only need to shoot clips shorter than 10 minutes you will probably never experience this issue.However this function can be problematic in situations where you need to shoot longer lengths of video, like at a conference, a sporting event, or a church sermon.One very helpful surprise that Cannon includes for free with this camera is the EOS utility software. With this software, the T3i, a reasonably modern computer (I use my MacBook Pro... 2010 vintage) and the included digital interface cable... you can extend the use of your laptop computer as a field monitor and command central for the camera.You can remotely control all important camera functions from within the very intuitive interface of this program.The EOS utility functions well for both photo and video shooting and provides a very nice simulation of what you will get...  This bonus has been particularly helpful to me for shooting video since it eliminated the need to purchase a $1,000 field monitor. Note though, that using the EOS utility will deplete your camera and laptop batteries faster than you would think. So I recommend plugging in your laptop and having a few extra batteries for your camera of getting the Canon DC coupler and power unit.The camera also has a very useful built-in flash that will automatically pop up when needed or can be accessed manually with the touch of a button.For more advanced photographers... the T3i supports the latest developments in wireless flash photography.SO who is this camera for?The T3i is best suited for those who want an easy to use, fast, reliable high-end prosumer DSLR that shoots incredible 18 mega pixel photos and FULL HD video... all in compact package for well under $1,000.If you plan on doing a lot of high speed photography you may want to consider the 60D for it's faster 5.3 frame per second continuous shooting... which is the only real major difference between the two. However this upgrade will cost you between $300 and $400.Also... if you want to save some money and don't really need the flip and turn LCD screen of the T3i... you many want to consider the T2i. This will save you around $100....I will caution you though...  if you ever think that you are going to want to shoot video, macro-zoom photographs or anything at high or low angles... you may be sorry that you didn't get the T3i with it's flippy screen.The T3i is also NOT for you if you want a compact, carry-in-your pocket camera to take with you everywhere... Even though the T3i is compact compared to many larger DSLRs... it's not small... So... if your main purpose is finding a camera to document life and have with you at all time... the T3i is probably not the camera for you.Also... If you want to eliminate your camcorder with the T3i, look somewhere else... that's not what the T3i is purposed for. It lacks seamless autofocus in video mode and is not as easy convenient to set up and use as many mini-camcorders.However, if you have a creative flair and want to shoot HD quality video productions, the T3i will help you get off to a great start.All this aside the Canon EOS Rebel T3i is an amazingly popular, all-around DSLR camera... which is evidenced by the fact that... at the time of this video review... the T3i is the #1 best selling DSLR on Amazon.The Canon T3i is an impressive value rivaling the Canon 60D in just about every way... and with it's full HD video, easy-to-use interface, exceptional 18 mega pixel image quality, large flip-and-turn LCD screen and a full set of professional functions... The T3i is a great place to jump into the wonderful world of DSLR photography and video... all for an astonishingly low street price of less than $800.VIEW MY FULL T3i VIDEO REVIEW with Test Video, Sample Photos and Time Lapse Video on YouTube by Searching '2012 T3i Best DSLR'Enjoy!"

As many of you are probably doing now, I had to decide which brand, then which model to pick. It was a tough choice, for the longest time I was trying to decide between the Nikon D3100 and the Canon T2i, but for just a little bit more, you get a nice flip-out high resolution screen, remote flash firing, and a few other goodies with the T3i. I'm not a photographer. In fact, I had absolutely no interest in photography until just recently. This is my first DSLR camera, and it's perfect for me. it has enough settings and features so I won't become easily bored, or 'grow out' of it, yet it has a great feature guide that tells you what each mode should be used for (fully customizable of course). The 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 Image Stabilized (IS) Kit lens that it comes with is perfect for getting used to the camera. It's good for those relatively close up group shots, or portraits. Even very small subjects can be brought into focus with this lens. And when your'e ready to upgrade, the 55-250mm IS lens is very reasonably priced (that's what I plan to get next anyway). I would recommend getting a SanDisk Extreme SD card to go with this (at least 8gb). OH! one last thing, the HD movie mode. That was another huge selling point for this camera. Although the Nikon D3100 AND the Canon T2i both have 1080p HD video recording, they do NOT have inputs for an external microphone. For some this might not be a big deal at all, but it's always a nice thing to have if you should want to dabble in the cinematography world in the future.Overall, GREAT camera, I would recommend it to anyone."

This camera is SO MUCH BETTER.

In full auto mode, the T3i beats the Nikon.  They are probably identical in the hands of a pro using manual settings, but in auto the D5100 has lousy white balance and notable motion blur.Then we compared the T3i head to head against the D5100, the Sony Alpha 55, and the Canon 60D.  Found the 60D to be too heavy, and that the 18-135mm lens is also too heavy and cumbersome.  I really liked the fixed mirror of the Sony and continuous phase autofocus in live view and movie mode.  But the snapshots of the T3i were slightly better.  With the shortcomings of the a55, it is probably a tier lower and thus overpriced.  I think we'd have bought the a77 over the T3i if both were $700 for the body and 18-55mm kit.The T3i excels under low light, the whole point of moving up from a point and shoot.  It was hard to not go with a mirrorless or fixed mirror system, but the T3i had the best pictures, simple as that.  After taking about 600 pictures in the last few days, had to learn a little about the semi-auto features.  Very useful are setting white balance to scene instead of using auto or a preset, and using portrait mode for indoor shots and putting the flash up or down as desired.  Also find shutter priority mode helpful to get shots without motion blur, and also like locking max auto ISO to 1600 or 800 for lower noise.The bottom line is that we get extremely natural looking photos taken indoors at night without flash.  I took pictures in dim tungsten lighting that look like they were taken in the afternoon with indirect sunlight coming in the windows.  Amazing--why we bought the camera and why it gets 5 stars.Also bought the Tamron 18-200mm zoom lens and the Rode Videomic Pro as accessories--both of those earn 5 stars, too.We purchased the T3i and the Tamron lens online from B&H who has a no-hassle return policy."

It is FANTASTIC! I got it ahead of schedule from Amazon, got the free backpack, filter and SDHD card free and it all worked! It was a serious gift to get the camera when I did, because I was doing some serious shooting that day and my Cannon point and shoot just didn't cut it.About the camera:-Its a Cannon, I would never use a different brand, ever. Its functions are mind-blowing! There are complaints about flash, how it was made with cheap plastic and all that nay-saying but if you're going to spend your money, get this camera!-Best pictures I've ever gotten. For someone who takes as many pictures as I do, quality is important.-I thought it would be heavy or difficult to use, but in an hour I had it mastered, and I think my point-and-shoot is heavier.-The 18-55mm lens is excellent, and I can't wait to purchase more.Bottom Line:Shell out the money, get the 18MP version, and never take bad pictures again!"

I already have the Canon T1i and have used it and loved it and thought that it would take a lot to beat it but the T3i has.  Using the kit lens from my T1i which is basically the same lens available with the T3i I took fantastic low light shots of my daughter's Christmas tree without a flash.  I used the 'P' setting with auto ISO and was very happy with the results.  I used a Tamaron 18-270 MM lens to take some low light shots of my house and the Christmas lights and again was amazed at the results.  Noise levels at even high ISO are very minimal and can be cleaned up with a good editing program.  I have yet to explore all the features of this camera or use the HD video feature but if it is as good as the results I have already seen, it will be amazing.  I am retired and have taken up digital photography as a hobby and while I am no expert or even close, I do consider myself to be an informed amateur and always research any camera before purchase so when I received this from my wife without my input I was a bit surprised but seeing the results very very happy.  The camera can be used by someone new to a DSLR with great results and I am sure that someone who is familiar with all the bells and whistles this camera has will produce amazing results.  I used the T1i while my friend used a Canon 1D and I feel my pictures where as good as his despite that the 1D is a superior camera so I am sure that the T3i will produce even better results.  I would recommend that any person interested in a great DSLR purchase this camera.  I also suggest that while the kit lens does a great job you invest in at least one good zoom lens that will expand your ability to take fantastic pictures."

I'd call myself at least a semi-professional, having had 10 different digital camera since my first (a Kodak DC120 that cost $1,000) in 1998, including a number of Nikons and Canons.  There are some very long reviews on this site for the T3i, so I'll spare you the details.  But, I take lots of different digital images (over 6,000 since April with this camera), from action photos of our grandchildren playing in their basketball and volleyball games to macrophotographs (using a Canon 100mm macro)of flowers and other organisms, and I'm almost always amazed by the results - images are sharp and colors are right on.  And a number of times folks around me looking at the results have commented on 'how amazing' the images are.  Videos have also been lots of fun to take, although the learning curve for getting good video is a little steeper than for still images.  And honestly, if I were going to take very much video, I'd get a dedicated video camera.  This camera, as one might expect, is very versatile, and the important lesson I learned early on is to read the book and go to the internet for advice on how to get the most out of it - some fantastic information there.  Practice, experiment, practice, experiment, etc., and not surprisingly, the more you do the better images you'll get. Common sense I know, but it is tempting and easy to simply set the camera on Scene Intelligent Auto setting and click away, expecting the best (and actually getting a lot when you do).  I rarely use that setting, choosing rather to mostly use the Program AE mode and customize my image taking to the situation.  I could go on and on, but I don't think you'll be sorry if you get a T3i.  It's worth the money!"

I wanted something small that had similar capabilities. I found it in the Panasonic Lumix range and sold all of my Canon gear.Then my daughter was born. Suddenly my major focus changed from landscape shots to portraits and Kodak moment type snaps of her. This was fine when we were outdoors but compact cameras really struggle in low-light situations. Two months ago, I decided it was time to dive back into the world of digital SLRs. I didn't need too many bells and whistles, just a simple SLR that could take fantastic shots of my daughter and her future siblings.I found it.This EOS is a super camera for the price. I used to pay 4 times as much to get lesser quality in the older cameras in the range. My brother, a professional photographer, has one of the best models in the series and even he is impressed with this basic model's capabilities.The new articulated screen is a good addition as is the ability to take HD video. The camera fills my hand nicely and is easy to hold stable due to the molded back. Th e software, screen menus,and buttons are all familiar and easy to understand. Anyone with previous Canon experience will feel right at home.The best part of all, though, is that I am now producing beautiful photos of my daughter with no effort whatsoever.I would recommend this camera to any new user to digital SLRs or users who want to come back to something bigger than a compact without going overboard."

My T3i camera will occasionally take pictures with compression lines running vertically through the picture.  This is about 1 in 10 pictures.  It is sort of like looking through wavy privacy glass.  I have lost critical wedding photos to this.So far over the course of 3 weeks trying to get a repair from the manufacturer Canon has blamed my laptop card reader, my workstation usb port, Windows 7 picture importer, Picasa picture importer, Lightroom picture importer, my class 10 SD card, my new class 10 SD card, My very newest professional 35mb/s SD card, and low batteries.  I have been run through multiple camera resets and I have actually been hung up on.  I have always been calm and professional when talking to support on the phone.Finally after multiple calls to Canon support they agreed to check the camera.  Now I have to ship it to Canons repair center paying for shipping and they will be keeping my camera for 10 business days for in house repair plus shipping times both ways.  There is no guarantee of fixing the problem or of swapping out my camera.  They actually stated on the phone that the 10 days could be longer as it is a busy time for them.  I am waiting to send it to them after years end as I do not want to be without a camera during Christmas two of my children's birthdays and New Year's. 1 in 10 bad photos is better than zero photos.  Canon will not advance replace cameras.I think if I had received a fully working camera this would be a 5 star review.  Instead I have to work with very poor customer support for a fairly expensive purchase.  I deal with Dell, HP, Microsoft and Cisco customer support at my work every day and Canon has by far the worst support or warranty I have had to deal with in recent memory.Hopefully your purchase will not need the support or warranty and you can simply enjoy a good product.

I have had a few cameras before this one including a few 14 megapixel cameras and this by far blew them out of the water. The clarity and the range that this camera gave me was like no other camera that I have had before. There are a few reasons that I would equate this camera with the best on the market but I cannot say it in only one sentence so here it goes; the good first, then the bad.PROS:First of all the QUALITY that you get for your money when it comes to Canon products is by far the best deal that you will get when it comes to excellent camera equipment. I bought an SLR from Nikon a few year back thinking that the saving would come in handy. However I did not expect the camera to have so many problems! Automatic focus would never work correctly, the white balance was always atrocious even after I would fix it continuously. It just seems like anything that could go wrong went wrong with that camera. That is why now I SWEAR BY THE SUPERIOR QUALITY OF CANON. The last 3 cameras I have owned have been Canon and I willnever go back.Enough with Canon, now this specific camera. The 18.0 MP CMOS sensor was definitely a step up for me. You could see the difference in high-fidelity when it came to the HD images. I was blown away by the processor speed as well. You rarely had to wait more than a few seconds in between shots and the DIGIC lived up to its hype among enthusiasts.The ISO which is denoting the realized speed was AWESOME. Not only was it versatile but the bright to dim modifications that you could change in the setting really set this camera apart in my opinion.This thing is FAST! I love it when electronic equipment can work at the same pace as my brain does, when I am taking pictures the last thing I want to think about is waiting on the camera to finish loading. Not with this. Canon got this right, this could also have a lot to do with the new innovative processor.I had been looking to invest in a camera for a long time. I love taking my camera out at the most inopportune moments and taking pictures of things that no one else would see the art behind. I was really inspired by my sister's camera choice a year back. She chose the Canon EOS but it was a different model then the one here.Another thing that I loved about this camera was the SCREEN SIZE! I love a big screen when I take pictures, it helps me put a scene or object into perspective better in my mind. Don't ask me why or how, it just does. By being able to see the picture that I took on such a large screen, I also can see what I need to improve in the picture and what I need to keep the same.Also, keeping with the screen, the menu options were so simple! I am a guy so the last thing I want to do is open up a manual but this thing to into account people of all skill levels!Speaking of pictures! THIS CAMERA TAKES EXTRAORDINARY PICTURES! Was cap locks necessary? Yes it was. Obviously your thinking, umm, yes of course this camera would take good pictures with the price your paying for it. But as I have looked around online this price point isn't too bad in relation to some other sites online.STARTLING VIDEO QUALITY! Ok I love to talk about this feature of the camera because I love the video camera on this camera. First off, a few weeks back there was an interview with the Japanese CEO of Canon asking him why Canon was seemingly breaking into the video industry when they were already the front-runner in quality when it came to still photography. He said that Canon would like to experiment with adding their quality into the video sector of the industry. Now if I was Sony I would be scrambling to get my cards together because if Canon starts breaking into the video industry you can guarantee that Sony is going to lose a lot of capital with their main competitor increasing their inventory capabilities. When asked if Canon would ever give up its still camera quality to pursue video the CEO said without hesitation that there is no way that Canon would ever stop innovating and improving their cameras. That is there roots and what has made them great and they will never give that up. This is good news for all you purists out there that just want to take beautiful pictures and leave the video to Hollywood and family time.CONS:DSLR's are BIG! Yes, I know, you didn't see that coming did you? Well, it's true and it definitely rears its head when you are at a amusement park or on a long trip and you have to haul your camera around everywhere with you. This isn't such a bad thing when you're going somewhere, like a wedding, to specifically take pictures but it can be definitely a hindrance when you're trying to move fast. If this doesn't bother you then more power to you, it bothers me. However, I knew how big this camera was when I got it and I still got it because the PROS DEFINITELY OUTWAY THE CONS IN MY OPINION. Also, if you have children around then I say BE CAREFUL. My kids almost broke this camera a few times which would have been a horrible thing.  Just make sure if you're going to buy this camera that it fits your lifestyle or you can conform that to fit your camera.The battery life is pretty short on this. I love to take a lot of pictures, upload them online and then edit them or delete depending on how good they are. This battery life was a little hard to do that with because you need to prioritize which pictures you want uploaded before the battery shuts off. This may seem like a pretty bad thing to some but once you have a routine down, like I do now, then it generally gets easier to gauge how much battery life you need to do certain things.These two things are probably the biggest things that I would criticize about this camera. This camera is as close to perfect as its going to get, on a budget, in my opinion.Summary:Life is about give and take and I believe this camera takes the least for your money.  I would love to tell you about every single little detail that I love or hate about this camera but I have told you the most important things in my opinion. Feel free to critique anything I said if you don't agree or post questions in the reply if you want more information, I would love to tell you. I have had this for about 4 months now and I will never go back to a point and shoot, this camera is the real deal and I give it a 5 starts easily.Happy buying!!"

Bought this camera, my first SLR, without any knowledge in photography. The camera is user friendly for the automatic mode, but I find that the automatic mode isn't much of an improvement from a regular P&S: colors aren't great, camera is slow to focus, moving kids- pictures far from great. For the cost of 4 good P&S cameras, I would expect MUCH better pictures.  Either I take a course in photography, for which I definitely I don't have time, or take it back to the store, save some money and keep getting mediocre photographs with a cheaper P&S.Another minus- got the lenses that come with the kit 18-55 and 55-250. The 55-250 doesn't shoot people that are close (you get the whole surroundings), but the 15-55 isn't enough zoom. Exchanging lenses in the middle of taking photographs- not doable (then you miss the picture you wanted, which was the idea of buying an SLR). Have to get some lens that covers more (such as 18-200). I understand now that if you want good photos, you really have to get into it, not for everybody."

I picked one up after doing a volunteer PA gig on a film crew this summer.  For a student, or anyone on a budget, the quality on this thing is magnificent.  I've put mine through some pretty sketchy situations (like duck taping it to the foot rest of a motor scooter, driving at speed) and it's held up well.  The on-board microphone is garbage, though, you can line in external recorder through the 1/8'' input.  The interface is deep enough to gain an understanding of the camera while retaining beginner's level simplicity. I've heard a lot of people complain about the kit lens, but you can compensate for it with a little meticulosity and composition skill.  You don't need thousands of dollars in glass to take reasonably good shots."

I am a published author and am currently writing my next how-to book on balloon twisting. The publisher wants to do ebook versions with video embedded, so I needed to find a reasonably priced way to create both pictures and videos for the ebooks. So far any fault with the video and pictures has more to do with my knowledge (or lack thereof) of good studio lighting and proper lenses for proper settings. The camera itself works great. Both the video and pictures are sharp. I read reviews on the camera and so got an external microphone to plug into the camera rather than using the built in one. Also the veri-angle LCD screen is great for being able to frame myself in the shot before starting to record since I'm usually doing these pictures and videos alone. It is definitely a purchase I would make again (but I shouldn't need to for quite a while)."

This is my first DSLR (I have several 35mm SLR) and it is so easy to use.  the menus are self explanatory.  I was suprised by how lightweight it is compared to the Nikon D5100. I'm a Nikon person so the D5100 was my first choice.  I played with my friend's D5100 and I found the menus and settings somewhat confusing compared to the Canon T3i.  I love using it for video too and I love that you can take stills while filming.  I chose the Canon because I already had other Canon lenses and because the price was right.  I was second guessing my choice until I received my camera and was blown away by how great the pictures came out and by the ease of use."

Always being interested in photography and being somewhat creative I thought that the point-to-shoot area has come to an end.  However, it is of course not a cheap investment - especially when you buy the T3i with the 18-135mm lens.  So you are perhaps wondering - was it worth the money?  And the answer is yes!  Even without getting to creative and playing with the variety of manual settings you can make photos in the auto-modes that will make your point-to-shoot camera photos look like photos taken with a cell phone.  The colors and focus on specific objects give the photos more dynamics.  The different modes allow you to select the right auto-setting for the object you are trying to capture.  The screen info on the T3i helps compared to the T2i (my dad has one) when you are new to such camera.  Overall I am very satisfied.  If you are considering to purchase the T3i, then you should think about getting the 18-135mm lens compared to the 18-55mm lens.  Reason being that the 135mm lens gives you more tele and you can zoom more than with the 55mm introduction lens.  If you are planning to get a tele-lens anyway and want to go higher up (i.e. 300mm), then the 55mm should do it.  However, I know myself and do not want to necessarily change lens depending on the distance of the object and the 135mm seems to be the right fit."

The kit 18-55 mm lens maybe isn't the best, but you can always buy the body by itself and get a nice prime lens. I'm a student filmmaker, and this camera works great. The swivel screen is great for when I have the camera up on my DIY jib and need to see what I'm looking at. HD video quality is fantastic, even in low light, and it'll only get better with a better lens. I had to film some interviews outside a club in low light, and even at ISO 1600 the noise wasn't distracting, and after a quick denoising pass it wasn't noticeable at all. The camera has an stereo audio input on the side if you don't have an external device to record audio to and, though the camera's weak pre-amp leads to noisier audio, it's definitely still usable. If you're a still photographer and don't need the swivel screen, get the T2i instead. But for filmmakers who want a great camera without have to sell their kidneys, the T3i is freaking sweet.P.S: This camera works with both the CineStyle profile and the Magic Lantern firmware. So.

This camera has everything you need for most still shooting, and full HD video, at a very affordable price! Like many of the reviewers before me, the kit lens leaves a bit to be desired. It looks good, reacts well, great glass,...but is built cheaper and lighter than the standard lens lineup and feels a bit 'break easy' for use every day. At this pricepoint, however,(I got mine during cyber week) there is flexibility to invest in a better lens. And with casual use the kit lens should last a good while. I'll update if I'm wrong about that!!The vari-angle monitor is very handy and has a crystal clear screen. If your used to Canon this is will familiar ground for you as most controls, and shooting modes, are right where they are supposed to be. Good, fast, AF. Live view. 18mp!

I will instead focus on the camera itself (the hardware/software) instead of the picture quality, which is SUPERB.PROS:The sheer amount of features allowed is nice.  As my first DSLR, I can only judge this camera against point and shoots.Everything can be tweaked and tuned as expected in a DSLR, but it also has a 'auto' mode, which is nice when you just want to take a quick shot and not have to worry about ISO settings, etc, etc.The shutter itself feels much better than a point and shoot, and the focus time, and the downtime between shots is also WAY lower than the run of the mill point and shoot.A feature I haven't seen as flexible in point in shoot is the timer shots.  You can set it to take anywhere from 1-10 pictures with 1 timer.  This is great for big family photos where you prop the camera up on a tripod and just want to do 10 photos in a row - and hopefully everyone will have their eyes open in one of those 10 photos (especially hard with little kids).CONS:The software/hardware feels sort of undated.  Canon has stuck with this same layout for a long time for continuity, but new point and shoots have a much more streamlined interface.  For example, the wheel on the top (where you switch between modes), does not allow for 360 degree rotation, only like 300 degrees rotation.  This means, for example, if you were in Video Capture mode and wanted to go to Macro Mode, you have to spin the wheel 300 degrees instead of just 60 degrees.The software is one that takes getting used to.  They use a 'tab' system to tell you which settings you are messing with in the Menu.  The tab system may be familiar to long time Canon users, but the way the tabs are labeled sometimes make it confusing.  Instead of using words, they use symbols, which I feel do not match well.  For example, there are 'tabs' with a Wrench icon.  Unless I memorize which setting is where, there is a hard time remember exactly what settings are changed in the 'wrench' tab.The battery must be charged separately from the device.  I don't know if this is a standard for DSLR, but I liked how I could just plug in my camera itself and charge it on point and shoots.Overall:There is no arguing the picture quality, it is basically the same as the T2i, and professional reviews all across the internet rate this as the top entry-level DSLR.  It has settings for a beginner like me, and it has settings for advanced users as well.For those wondering between T2i and T3i, the main difference is a spin-out LCD screen, and digital zoom during video.  These differences are small, and I know I was confused when I first researched this DSLR.  The T2i and T3i are much more similar than the T3 vs T3i.T2i or T3i - Get either, T3/T2 are a lower-end model, they are made for two different budget targets."

I wish that you could have more frame rate options in 720p and I also wish that ISOs above 400 were a little less noisy.The kit lens is nice, but I recommend that you get a larger telephoto lens.  The default auto-focus doesn't work to great in the dark, but the quick auto-focus is nice since it shows you green boxes where it's focused.  It's nice that you can zoom in using the LCD screen so that you can ensure your focus is good, but unfortunately, this doesn't work while in video mode.There's not fully-automatic auto-focus in video mode, but usually the cameras that do are too noisy.  You can change the settings so that half-way pressing the shutter button makes it refocus, but it does the slower method and changes the exposure while it focuses.The battery lasts plenty long when doing photos, but video...not so much.  If you plan on doing a video shoot of any length, you'll need to purchase additional batteries.  I'd recommend getting a battery/power grip.  They have a cheap one on here that comes with 4 batteries and has a timer for doing delayed photos and time lapses that I'd recommend.Also, for fun, install the Canon EOS Utility on a laptop.  You can use your laptop to take pictures, do time-lapses, change settings on the camera, and more.Technicolor has a picture profile you can download called CineStyle, which is good for color grading your video in post.  Otherwise, I recommend the Faithful picture style that the camera comes with.Check out LegendaryMedia and 8bitDigitalTV for pictures and videos using the T3i."

A major factor in reducing noise, the CMOS sensor assures that images shot at highest sensitivity will be remarkably smooth.Features worth notingWhen you look at this class of DSLR, sophisticated entry level, there are a handful of impressive features that add value to this investment. In addition to a reliable picture taking machine, T3i owners can experiment with off-camera flash, record HD movies with great audio, and creatively play with their images while they're still in camera. Here are a few of those highlights.Built-In Wireless Flash Control (new feature for Rebels) If you have an external Canon flash unit with wireless slave capability, such as the Speedlite 430EX II, you can fire it off-camera with the T3i. You don't need a separate wireless controller. Options include firing a single off-camera flash, balancing the off-camera flash with the built-in flash unit on the T3i, or operating multiple external flashes. The upshot is that with just one external flash and the T3i, you have a number of flexible lighting options. This is a powerful feature for a consumer camera, putting pro lighting techniques at your fingertips for an affordable price.Vari Angle LCD (new feature for Rebels) The T3i's adjustable LCD is an excellent design for recording video. You flip open the LCD, then swing it out. You can angle up or down, or turn it completely around and fold it against the back of the camera. The resolution is terrific both for Live View capture and playback. When you're done, turn the screen around and secure it face-first against the back of the camera to protect it during transport. This encourages capture from a variety of angles helping you make more interesting movies while not straining your back and neck in the process.Full HD Movie Recording with Controls On the T3i you can record 1920x1080 video at 24, 25, or 30 fps; plus 1280 x 720 video at 50 or 60 fps; or standard definition 640 x 480 video at 25 or 30 fps. Emerging filmmakers can opt for auto or manual exposure mode while shooting video, and even choose between auto and manual options for recording audio. The audio is further enhanced thanks to the built-in mini-stereo mic jack for an external microphone. There's even a built-in wind filter.Video Snapshot Function This feature allows you to record a series of 2, 4, or 8 second video clips, then, without editing, the T3i combines them into one movie that can be saved to your Mac or played via the HDMI port that allows direct connectivity to an HDTV. Each Snapshot is saved to an album after you record it, and you have the opportunity to keep or discard the clip. Once you've captured the various sequences, go to playback mode and watch the fast-paced move you've just created. It's a cool feature that saves you a trip to the desktop movie editor. Once you're finished, disable the Video Snapshot mode to return to regular movie making.Creative Filters After you've captured an image, you can continue to play with it via the Creative Filters mode in the playback menu. There are five to choose from: Grainy B/W, Soft Focus, Fish-Eye Effect, Toy Camera Effect, and Miniature Effect. Once you choose an effect, you can apply one of three different strengths. When you're finished, the T3i processes the image and saves it as a separate file on the memory card. The new Fish-Eye effect is a new addition to the Creative Filter line up, and one of the most interesting effects. Be careful, though, it can be addictive.Setting Maximum Speed for Auto ISO Existing-light photographers will appreciate the ability to set the maximum speed for Auto ISO. Auto ISO, without a top limit setting, can sometimes result in noisy photographs. The T3i allows you to set the maximum ISO speed to a level you're comfortable with so you can use this feature with confidence.The available range is from 400 to 6400. If you're conservative about how high you want the ISO to go, then you can choose a setting such as 800 for the top end limit. But because this camera performs so well at higher ISOs, you can easily set the limit to ISO 1600 or 3200 and still get very good image quality. The choice is yours.Star Ratings In Camera While viewing images in playback mode on the T3i, you can assign a star rating to it. These ratings are transferable to Aperture, Bridge, and Lightroom, but not iPhoto. So when you upload your images to your Mac, the star ratings are displayed to help you immediately identify your favorite shots.Copyright Information Setting When you access the Copyright Information tab in the Menu, you can set the author's name and copyright details for every shot that is recorded with the camera.Image qualityWith either kit lens, the 18-55mm or the 18-135mm, the Canon T3i provides excellent image quality in terms of sharpness and detail. If you're tempted to upgrade to the 18-135mm kit lens for its extended zoom range (29-216mm in 35mm terms), then it's probably worth the bump in price. But in terms of image quality, the 18-55mm holds its own nicely against the upgraded zoom. So don't expect better pictures with the more expensive kit option. Base your decision on zooming range, not picture quality.Even though either kit zoom isn't a particularly fast lens (maximum aperture ranges from f/3.5 to f/5.6 on both), the T3i is a reasonable low light performer because you can push the ISO to 1600, even 3200, and still get quality images.In our lab tests, the T3i performed incredibly well in its test group, earning a word score of Superior in the Exposure, Color, Sharpness, and Distortion categories. Click on any of our lab's test images to view the original files.DrawbacksThe limited amount of physical real estate on the T3i seems to have influenced the location of control buttons. The Menu and Info buttons are awkwardly placed in the upper left corner of the back of the camera. They're not nearly as easy to access there as, for example, the 60D's placement of them on the right side.The T3i would also benefit from the addition of a dedicated movie record button. Currently, you have to rotate the Mode dial to movie mode, then you can initiate recording with the Live View button on the back of the camera. It would be nice to directly access movie recording for those spontaneous moments.And finally, as with most Canon cameras, Auto White Balance produces excessively orange cast when shooting without a flash under tungsten lightingI would recommend that to anyone looking to buy a DSLR and it's probably the best DSLR I know today"

However, if you are going to be taking video with it, be aware that one huge defect is that it does not have autofocus.  In other words, while you are taking video, you need to manually focus with the lens and this is bothersome.  Most point and shoot cameras have autofocus, so since this was my first SLR, I was disappointed to see the lack of this useful feature.I can not say anything negative of the still pictures this camera takes.

I researched for months and I really wanted a Nikon but at the time there weren't any new Nikons out and the newest DSLR in my price range was the T3i. I talked to every one I knew with a DSLR and they all said it was a great camera. So I decided to give it a shot.I love this camera. I only used Auto for the first few months while I learned what all the buttons did (I prob still dont know them all). Now I almost never shoot in auto unless I cant get the picture I want then I try auto.Pros:Great screenthe screen rotateseasy to use buttonsthe pictures turn out amazinggreat battery lifeCons:Price, Im cheap and I know it.

Sharpness was only fairly good (even when manually focused) with two different lens - not razor sharp like most of my previous Olympus cameras.  Colors were not fully lifelike so the images looked 'digital' instead of filmlike. Here again I was spoiled by my previous good experiences with Olympus cameras.  I did generally like the T3i's video, but here again colors were often inconsistent and the .mov files were huge and a pain to work with.After three months of fustration I bought an inexpensive Olympus Pen camera and was delighted with it's still image color and sharpness.And I also bought an inexpensive Panasonic SD90 camcorder for video because it's delivers superior image sharpness, image stabilization and zoom capabilities compared to my T3i in the more efficient ACHVD format.  I will sell the T3i because I want top quality still image and video and the Canon T2i, T3i, 60D and 7D deliver only mediocre quality in my opinion."

However, at best this camera is a B-Camera.  It will not replace your camcorder due to the fact that it does not auto focus while recording.  In the manual, it does show you that you can AF while recording, but you constantly have to press the shutter button halfway.  One of the bad side effects is that refocusing is slow.  The AF speed isn't as lightning fast as if you're in Photo mode.  By the way, the AF is snappy quick when you're doing still shots.  So while you video record and press the shutter button to refocus, the camera CAN take 1-2 seconds until focus confirmation is achieved (HD video focus set to 'AF-Quick' for those wondering about my settings).  This has been my experience with my Canon 17-40mm f4 L lens.  Another bad side effect (and the manual mentions it) is that if you are video recording and you press the shutter button to refocus, your video's Exposure changes.  Let's say it took 1.5 second to refocus, your recorded video will have sudden dark and bright scenes in that 1.5 second.  IT IS NOTICEABLE and VERY DISTRACTING.  I need to do more test to see if I can eliminate that.  The manual does not recommend this style of refocusing and to just do a manual refocus by hand using the lens's focus ring.Another thing I hate about this camera when video recording is that it will NOT let you select a slower shutter speed below 1/30 sec.  I own a Panasonic AG-HMC40 3CCD camcorder, and I can adjust the shutter/Aperture independently.  I can shoot at 1/12 sec at 24p.  But with this camera, I can't go lower than 1/30 sec if I shoot at either 30P or 24P.  At 60P, you can't go lower that 1/60 sec.  This was something I was not aware of prior to purchasing this camera.  Others will say, why would you want to shoot at a low shutter speed?  Well you can do strobe effects, or more importantly, the lower the shutter speed, the more light you can get.  Sometimes I use 1/12 sec for static night shots.EDIT -- I just realized that I can get better video footage under dark lighting when the 'Movie Exposure' is set to AUTO.  I've had it set to Manual.  This is counter-intuitive to what I've been used to for my camcorder.Another thing I hate about this camera is the 12 minute time limit of HD recording!!!  From my test, the camera will STOP recording after 12mins.  I am recording with a 16GB SDHC card.  The user manual mentions it and is not a defect (but a handicap, IMO).  So if you set this camera on a tripod and start recording, you have to hit the record button every 12 minutes to continue.  This means that your video will not be smooth.  You'll have segments of video clips that don't seam together smoothly.It's 12min per 4GB on 24P, 30P and 60P.  By the way, I haven't had any overheating issues while recording.  But the camera does become WARM.  I was doing these test on a 68 degrees ambient room temp.  I'm not sure about summer time recording.  The user manual does mention about overheating.I'm really trying to love this camera, but I think I've been spoiled by my camcorder.But if you've read this far in this review, here's what I like about it:CONVENIENCE!  It's great to have a DSLR that can shoot excellent still shots and do HD video.SIZE! I've been to places where I absolutely can't bring both a DSLR (with 3 L-series lenses) and a camcorder at the same time... too much baggage and weight.  This consolidates everything in a nice small package.  It's small enough to not attract too much attention.  It's not as big as my camcorder, hence I can finally use a small camera bag.VARIO-SCREEN.  This is a camcorder trait that's finally on a DSLR.  I LOVE IT!  I can finally take some low or high position shots with ease.IMAGE QUALITY:  I own a Canon Rebel XT and the Canon 5D classic (not MK2).  This camera produces some really nice image, especially if you use some high quality lens.PRICE: I was thinking of getting the 60D, but price became a leading factor.  I paid $659 new, body only.Final thoughts:  I will most likely keep the camera because I already own some nice Canon lenses, but for those still debating about getting the Canon T3i or even the Nikon equivalent, I would recommend you look at the Sony A65.Why didn't I get the Sony A65?  I'm in too deep with Canon.  I've already bought some great lenses for the Canon Mount.  If you read this review and genuinely considered this camera, I suggest you get the SONY A65.  It has all the dislikes that I have about this camera fixed on their camera and more.  But if you already have some canon lenses, hold off until next year.  Canon MAY come out with a new DSLR body that can fix all of these issues.Recommendation:  If you decide to get this camera, then get a battery pack grip attachment with extra batteries!!!  YOU WILL NEED IT.  The battery that came with the camera (Genuine Canon) died before I can even fill up my 16GB card.  I did straight HD shooting with no rest and the battery indicator turned RED.  The screen is constantly on when you video shoot.  The optical view finder can't be used while HD recording because of the mirror flipped and locked.  This is an absolute essential if you decide to get some accessories.Good luck and shoot!"

I last used a 35mm SLR about 15 years ago. I was used to being able to quickly and easily adjust aperture, iso and shutter speed. Since then I've used a progression of Canon digital point and shoots. When I got the T3i I was expecting a similar experience to my SLR days, but was sorely disappointed. To make changes with the T3i, you have to navigate through a difficult to use menu one the LCD display. With the 60D you're able make those changes much more easily without using the LCD menu. The small screen on top of the camera is a big help and displays the current settings. Otherwise the two cameras are capable of taking the same quality photographs.If you can, I would suggest trying both cameras out and seeing which you're more comfortable using.Pros for the 60D: Change settings more quickly, longer battery lifeCons for the 60D: Heavier and more expensivePros for the T3i: Lighter and less expensive.Cons for the T3i: More difficult to navigate menu and change settings, also shorter battery life"

The audio controls is also really awes! The zoom feature while in movie mode is nice too. Because im only shooting with a 50mm prime right now, being able to zoom in makes it really nice. Sure its only a digital zoom, but with good lenses, not zoomed to full capacity, it should work well. Even at 3x, that turns my lens into a 150mm, sort of. haha.

I resisted and ended up waiting to purchase the T3i, which was the best decision I made. At a glance the camera has a good feel to it and overall has the same features as the T2i. The main differences I noticed in it were the flip out LCD screen, which I use more often for some of the photos I take. Among the screen, the improvement to the video truly being 1080p and the simple menu. The camera itself is very user friendly whether you have read the manual or not. I am a person to read through and learn the various features the camera has to offer. I am impressed with the lens that comes with the camera for the wide angle aspect of it due to a lot of places I shoot pictures there are a lot of people and requires me to get close to get the shot I want. Disappointed they offer HDMI input, but don't provided the cable. I have only scratched the surface of my purchase, but I am pleased thus far.

Most of my photography consists of dogs and nature out kayaking, playing on a beach, or out camping.  I have the Canon T2i, and am thrilled with it all around.  I have two favorite L lenses... the 24 - 70 mm and the 70 - 300.  I also have several primes that I use as well.Since I cannot stand running out of battery, I also use a battery grip.  I recently bought a double harness so I could more easily manage out in the field while using my Rebel with the long lens and my G10 for close or wide angel shots, since I managed to crack the LCD screen on the G10 by carrying them both around my neck.  When it came I realized how off balance it was with one heavy camera and one light so I bought the T3i as an early Christmas gift for myself.I wanted another T2i, because I don't do video OR creative filtering in camera so the changes from the 2 to the 3 didn't appeal to me at all.  I LOVE my T2i, but somehow couldn't justify spending nearly the same amount as the new model cost.The camera came today and I did a few test shots between the two using exactly the same subject, flash, and lens.  I actually have to admit, the ones with the T3i came out obviously ahead of the T2i, even before any editing was preformed.  I was really surprised since I expected them to be exactly the same.I am nervous about the articulated LCD screen breaking off and I wasn't thrilled that the screen doesn't shut off like the T2i did, but I guess both worries are easily solved by keeping it turned around.I do wish Canon would make a STILL camera without the addition of video, but I do understand the appeal of video to some people.  I only used it once with the previous Rebel and I must admit, it was quite good!!!In closing, unless I discover something bad in the next few weeks, I expect this camera will also become a favorite, and congratulate Canon on continuing their great Rebel tradition!!!"

So the camera has 80% of the things that its bigger brothers have: a gorgeous LCD screen, same processor as other crop sensor cameras, 1080p video recording, wirelessly controlling flashes. It's also lightweight and compact. The kit lens is great, too. Of course you can't compare it to an L-lens, but I think for just $110, it has an unbeatable value/price. I'm now thinking to upgrade to 5d Mark III once it's available and this was my first DSLR, but I can honestly say that it served me very well while I was an amateur. For those of you who are interested in the camera, I strongly recommend buying the 430 Ex II flash as well.Pros:Price1080p videoCompact and lightweightGreat lens for priceCons:Focus points are not as good as the expensive models(which is justified by the price)ISO is usable only until 800"

Let me just say, I am in LOVE with this camera.  I know that there are bigger, better (more expensive!) choices out there, but for me, the T2i was the perfect fit.  I researched cameras for well over a month, reading review after review, blog after blog, and ultimately they all pointed in the same direction.  Anything more powerful (or with more buttons to figure out) was going to be a waste of money on my part.  The T2i will do more than I probably will EVER need and the price point was just right.  When my p&s camera first bit it, I had seen the all new Canon EOS 60D & immediatley decided that I HAD TO HAVE IT.  I am so glad that I fought off the urge to purchase it before doing some research.

I was actually quite hesitated about this package purchase since it really cost a lot, around 850 dollars in total. But the moment I saw this camera, I so loved in it! It's made of high quality in terms of the material and the details. I took several sample shots. The speed was amazingly fast and with the 55-250 lens I was able to get a quite impressive shallow depth of field. It captures low-light conditions very well."

I found this camera to be an easy one to get started with right off the bat.  I got a little confused with the directions for how to handle the menu settings at first and I still haven't figured out how to manage the flash (I've only been working with it for 10 days) but I was out shooting great pictures within two days. Clear and sharp on auto. Uploading them to the computer was a challenge.  I couldn't seem to find directions on how to do that.  I would have thought it would be an automatic plug in and something would show up on the screen deal.  Not so in my case.  The software is confusing but it looks like when I get used to it it will be really good.  It's hard to write a review on something when you've only had something like a camera for such a short time, but I bought it on the recommendation of my brother who has the T2i and I'm not sorry I did.

I recently went on a cruise to Alaska and found myself hiking up a mountain, sweating a lot with the camera around my neck I learned once I made it back to the bottom of the mountain, that the camera was acting up.. I guess some of that sweat ended up in the camera and basically it became a brick.  Once back on the ship, I tore it apart and over night it dried itself.. in the morning it was working completely fine and I have never again witnessed a problem.. learned my lesson however and have since placed a rain hood on it.The tech on this thing is great, with the ability to not only shoot in RAW mode but RAW+ mode, giving you both types of files for each shot.. this is a great time-saving feature, not having to convert from RAW for those shots that do not require the major file size.Leaving it in auto mode, even a child can use it since it is completely auto. My friend who has never used an SLR before bought the T2i at Costco before the cruise so I was teaching her the basics and she caught on pretty quick.  She had troubles with one of her lens when she gave the camera to me to take her picture, I thought it was a hair on the gate but it turned out to be part of the autofocus gear as the autofocus would not function without a small nudge. Upon returning to Seattle she returned it to Costco for a full exchange as they didn't have any in stock, she ended up buying a new one when in Texas and even saved a little on the tax. That being said, and the fact that hers was the T2i and this review is about the T3i.. the only real difference was the retractable viewfinder which is a must for me, that and the video mode offers a few more enhancements but I don't believe anyone should be buying a DSLR for the sole purposes of shooting video but that being said, you most certainly can use it, especially with all the available remote adapters (ie: focus puller, cables)The battery life is very good. I purchased two additional batteries knowing full well what it is like in the field when you are running low on juice."

I bought a used Canon EX back in the 70' when my first son was born. Over the years I must have taken a million pictures with that guy. As time went by and digital technology got better I bought a Sony Cyber-shot 3.3 maga pixels. It has a fairly large Carl Zeiss Lens and took beautiful pictures but was slow. When my youngest son started playing basketball I needed something faster I went back to my Canon 35mm camera and got good shots but the digital age has spoiled me and I hated having to wait for prints to be developed. I went ahead and bought a Sony Digial Handycam and took movies of his whole high school basketball and football career. Fast foward to 2011. I decided that I needed an SLR camera again. I was missing too much with the point and shoot camera that I had. It was good for shooting outdoors but in low light situations it did poorly. I started shopping around for SLRs. After reading a lot of reviews and it came down to a Canon or a Nikon. I went with the Canon because I had history with Canon and felt comfortable with it. I bought it from Amazon, they had a summer deal going on and I got the long lens added to the package for $30 bucks. Out of the box this guy is fantastic, it takes beautiful low and very low light pictures. Everything I have shot with this camera has come out sharp and crisp. I bought a DVD telling how to get more out of this camera and am amazed with it's capabilieies. I'm trying to learn how to do everything that is possible with this camera but that'll take a while. I'm also finding that many of the quality accessories for SLRs are very resonably priced. Bottom Line; Everytime I pick this guy up, I feel like I'm shaking hands with an old friend."

The camera mirror was damaged when it arrived and Amazon replaced it with next day delivery allowing me 30 days to return the damaged camera.  I was really impressed with Amazon!

Works great in still and video modes. The only thing that the description doesn't give any information about is the type of memory card to be used. In the manual, they say Class 6 (6 MBps) or higher. And I have purchased a 32GB Class 6 SDHC card, and it can only record 640x480 30fps video. But lets be honest, you buy an amazing camera with pretty cool features and why do you want to compromise on some feature that degrades the whole purpose of the camera.But anyways, I did some research about HD video recording on DSLRs and found that even though Class 6 SDHC cards work great with the photos, they don't work for HD videos. And the best memory cards suitable for the HD video recording are supposed to be Class 10 (10 MBps) or higher. And following that I also found that in some cases Class 10 (10 MBps) might also not work. And I did further research for find the apt memory card for HD video would require minimum of 30 MBps data rate (45 MBps would be better). But I had to compromise and buy the 30MBps version which is quite costly (about $95).So, if you are buying this camera for a photography purpose its a wonderful and great camera. But provided the memory card is suitable for HD video recording, the video camera also works great!!.I need not give any more info regarding the image quality and other stuff, they are always there for any camera...I would definitely recommend this for a friend!!"

As an amateur, I guess I'll let the video quality speak for itself here. Let me tell you this camera has taken over my summer. Every chance I get I use it, I do. It features a wide array capabilities fit for experienced and beginning photographers. Its abilities are limitless. You can check out some my youtube channel for more 'oceansidecreations' and make sure to hit like.Pros: Interchangeable lens, sensor and swivel screenCons: buttons, gripe, and low light.Bottom line:Love it, you'll get use to the buttons and small body. I got a tripod which made my life a lot easier. Another feature I love is the ability to edit video from your camera (trimming beginnings and endings). Editing is arguably the hardest part of filming. So the ability to trim down footage on the fly is beneficial. Also, The tilty swivel screen comes through all the time. As far as the 10x digital zoom goes, I can honestly say I hardly ever use it. If you have any other questions, please ask.I was conflicted between getting this and the 60D. I love the body design on the 60D, but wasn't feeling the extra debt for the same sensor. If you are an amateur, just grab the T3i. If you are an experienced photographer and use your camera more readily. Than I'd go with the 60D. Just keep in mind its due for an upgrade. Either way I love my camera and I back it 100 percent."

I had received a Rebel film SLR years ago with the hope of taking it up as a hobby.  I can say, I've picked up photography as a hobby, but rather with a series of Canon digital point-n-shoots over the years.  The latest is an aging Ixus, the model number escapes me.  Yes, I'm rather fond of the Canon brand.  They have served me well shoved in countless pockets and packs throughout travels and tribulations.I ordered this camera two days before my wedding, figuring that the shots would necessarily be better than my point-n-shoot.  Amazon's Sunday delivery was exemplary and of good value.  I remembered the pre-sets on my original Rebel that could give instant access to better pictures without needing to understand apertures, etc. - I realize that's probably nails on a chalk board to some.  What I didn't intend on, was being absolutely floored by the stunning quality of shots that myself and all other family members (of much less experience snapping pics than I) were able to get on the day of our wedding.For those who are looking for an 'in' into the world of DSLR photography, this camera is easy to understand right out of the box.

I am a pro photog and video guy with 40 years of experience, so I know how to take a picture or shoot video.Set the camera on AUTO mode, what can be wrong here... well the same blurry image. Nothing in focus, yet it showed it was in focus. Yes, the LIVE VIEW or the optical view does show a CLEAR image, but when loaded onto a computer, it's all blurry when you look at it a bit closer. I compaired with several Nikon DSLR just to make sure maybe my eyes are not good as use to be... the Nikon images from a low cost D-40 is far superior with a kit lens than this 18mp image is full of noise in full sunlight, on AUTO mode or ANY OTHER settings.This was out of the box BAD.Sent it Canon and they sent it back as 'fixed'. NOTHING has changes and they say it's normal and all is OK.Am asking you, If I shoot a 1.2Mp setting on a D40 Nikon and a 18mp setting on T3i and the Nikon is superior quality and sharpness then this T3i what do you think it's wrong? To Canon repair it is fine.Then I set it to 1.2Mp or slightly higher on the T3i and the images is sooooo blurred even a toy camera can do better.Next I used an old Canon SD-800 camera set at 1mp (close to it) and it's image is superiour to this Canon 18Mp !So, it's not me and  not knowing how to use a camera. I have six DSLR and many other cams.Canon refuse to replace this LEMON and just giving me the run around.In addition the Movie mode shuts off with a Class-10 SD card after a ten seconds. NOT selected the 10 seconds shots... but it does it on its own. After five tries, finally gets to record in video mode. The image quality is so bad, with the kit lens and other lenses from 24mmm to 50mm. Makes no difference, but the prime lens is a 'sharper' BLURRY image... if you can believe it.So, I have a $1K down the toilet and Canon don't stand behind their products.I urge everyone buying any Canon model DSLR to check it out within a few days and if no good, take it back to the STORE!I missed that opportunity and now stuck with this 'repair' revolving door and getting nowhere.This maybe a refurbish by Canon or someone taken this back to the store, repackaged and sold as new.... at Walmart.I don't blame Walmart, and I don't think they have anything to do with refurbish or re-sold cameras without indicating as such.

I own a 5DII and and T2i and I needed something inexpensive that would work beautifully with the footage from those cameras.  My first thought was to get a small point and shoot with quality video that I could just throw on a tripod and let it go for a good wide angle shot.  However, the price points weren't too far off from this gem right here.  Being that I already have lenses for my Canon DSLR's, I decided to go with this.  Needless to say, I love it. The articulating LCD screen is a super plus that I was missing with my T2i and it's really helpful in capturing those low and high angle shots I love."

This is my 1st DSLR.Read several reviews & chose this over the comparable Nikons with slightly better sensor technical specs, mostly for the swivel viewfinder.  I had one on a Canon G-3, & really missed it.  Lots of shots my favorite become possible only when I can brace the camera high against a fixed object, or cradle it low in both hands, and frame the shot in the swivel viewfinder instead of aligning subject, camera & eye.Happy with the choice for many reasons.  The range of application, shooting RAW with this 18-135mm lens, is enormous.  Camera+lens is very lightweight, easy to handhold, & the lens is remarkably compact for its range.  I use it as a macro lens (.38 image size, I think, but don't rely on my memory), for some landscapes & portraits, & lots of tight telephoto shots.  It's a great 'walkabout' lens--shot whatever happen to see, wherever you are.  I shoot mostly aperture priority stills, stopped down to 9 or 11 for sharpness, mostly ISO 100 to minimize noise, but sometimes 400 or higher to get short exposure times.  I've gotten some nice shots of birds in flight or running grand kids, using the 'sport' mode, which auto focuses while I track the subject, & keeps shooting as long as the button is pressed.  Reviewers claimed that the controls are more accessible on the Canon, and I have found it easy to set useful defaults and make shot-to-shot adjustments in the most important controls.I had been dissatisfied with the lens speed & dynamic range on my point-&-shoot, and was worried that this lens is not very fast & the sensor does not have quite the dynamic range of the competing Nikon.  However, I discovered that my real problem was that JPEG gives you only one exposure for the whole frame unless you shoot multiple-exposure HDR.  Shooting RAW, I can back down the highlights & boost the shadows when the intensity is uneven, and that actually solves my problem.  Also gives me a more natural look that I prefer to most of the HDR I've seen.  The sensor has greater dynamic range than the final JPEG, so even more would provide diminishing returns.  Even with a cropped sensor, I'm not having much problem with lens speed, even for macro shots & indoor light. Graininess at very high ISO can be filtered, but sometimes it's a nice effect.I did eventually get the Canon 100-400mm EF L lens for even longer telephoto shots, & probably will eventually get a high-end wide &/or macro lens as well.  They say you should spend most of your available money on lenses rather than bodies, so it may be quite a while before I upgrade the T3i.I went through a photo drought for over a year, but since I got this kit I'm shooting a lot.  1000-2000 exposures a week on a couple of recent vacation trips, steady use in between, many diverse projects, posting new work on Flickr daily.  Great fun."

The T3i is absolutely perfect for this.I don't actually care about the video-taking capabilities of this camera, though when I have taken video with it, it's been fine. What I really care about is how well it takes pictures, and for that, it's fantastic. The full-on automatic setting is great, sometimes taking a much better picture than I would have. The 'no-flash automatic' is what I tend to use most, especially in indoor areas like museums. When I want to play with DOF, the Aperture Priority setting is excellent.This camera performs admirably in low-light settings, often getting shots without a flash that shock me with their quality. In Lightroom, I don't have to do much postprocessing to get my shots to come out looking great. My only complaint is that the automatic setting does tend to overexposure, so if you're in a situation where the lighting isn't standard, keep an eye on that and switch to a more manual setting. It's a lot harder to fix overexposure than underexposure.If I have any complaint about this camera, it's that I would have liked more, or better, indicators via the viewfinder. I find I use the viewfinder -- which is not, by the way, the brightest or sharpest viewfinder I have ever seen -- more than the LCD monitor by far -- to the point where I sometimes don't flip the LCD monitor over at all. And about the flipping -- that's a very nice touch. I don't often use it like one would use a side-view mirror, but I do love that flipping it over protects the screen.Likely, if you're an enthusiast who can afford this camera, you're not going to use the postprocessing techniques in the 'Creative mode' section of the camera; you'll use an outside tool like Lightroom. I wouldn't put much stock in being able to, for example, apply a magenta tone to your picture. And labelling on-phone is a giant pain. Unless you think you'll forget the location, don't even bother.The kit lens on this camera is actually quite good - I alternate between the kit lens and the f/1.8 50mm that everyone who owns a Canon DSLR should have. Unless you're wanting to take significant zoom images, it's a clear, fast lens for most work.For what I wanted this camera to do, I have found it to be absolutely fantastic."

At first I decided on the Nikon 5100 because I've always like my coolpix, my relatives own Nikon DSLRs (higher end),  and the wonderful reviews online. I ended up returning that one because the LCD goes black when turning it 180 deg. after only a  week of shooting and felt discouraged after reading about Nikon customer service rating online. My friend suggested Canon 'easier to learn if you are new to DSLR' she said.Somehow, after playing with the controls and reading the manual that came with this camera, it made me realized why and how people would use manual, Av, Tv, P mode. (I thought it would be too to complicated and cumbersome to do when I had the Nikon). This camera is very intuitive, you can change desired settings without taking your eyes off your subject. I think it will be easy to always remember how to change the main settings.Now I am excited about learning composition,exposure, etc  and improve my picture taking skills.Btw, had a chance to compare the portrait of my daughter I took with the d5100 (P mode) vs the t3i, this kit lens (18-55) seem to be very sharp, with accurate skin tone. I got worried at first because I think I prefer a softer look of skin tone, like her skin with the d5100 ( like it was airbrush, although it seems to have more red tones from d5100, not sure if I like that).  Luckily ,there is a setting I can adjust for a softer look in different degrees on this camera. THIS definitely is a keeper."

IQ is very good using the kit 18-135.  I suspect IQ would be even better with a higher quality lens.The only occasional fault is missing focus once in a while.

They are small but quite significant to some people. If a t2i can be found for considerably less than the t3i ( $150 or more)  I would seriously consider it.The t3i is quite capable video wise, however it has no autofocus in video mode.  This is hit or miss for some people who don't like the autofocus constantly adjusting during recording yet it is difficult to zoom and focus at the same time.The t3i is absolutely a beginner higher level camera (I'm a beginner).  So its relatively easy to learn on yet takes awesome high quality HD photo and video.You'll need a high class SD card (I bought a 32 GB Transcend and am so far quite happy with it).Overall I am quite happy with the camera and certainly not trying to turn any one off about buying it, only inform others of things I came to learn AFTER buying mine.You should definitely research the t2i as well as the Nikon competitor of this camera before settling on this model."

Will edit this if this does not turn out to be true. My switch was mostly due to pathetic nikon warranty service.The IS works really well and I think better than nikon's which I had tried for a week with a borrowed D5000.Digital 3x zoom in video mode.The 430EX II external flash can be supported by the camera wirelessly. On nikon's this is only true for the more expensive SB800s flashes.Cons:Auto focus in 'live view' mode (seeing through the lcd instead of the viewfinder) is extremely slow. Makes me not ever wanting to use it.Most canon lenses have loud autofocus motors. The lenses with the nicer USM AF motors are too expensive.No mode in canon to set Av mode and set min shutter speed while letting the camera pick the ISO. Standard in Nikons. Canon seems to pick the shutter speed based on the zoom (focal length selected).White balance in Full auto mode sometimes messes up. Some pictures came out blue-ish.No good priced 'normal' 50mm/35mm lens available. There is only one 50mm el-cheapo which apparently looks extremely cheap but I will buy it anyway.I upgraded from nikon D50 to this. So of course the pictures are much much better.In hindsight, The nikon D5100 has a better (larger DX sensor vs canon APS sized sensor) sensor. So less noise on the Nikon.Also, I think that video modes in SLR cameras are fairly useless unless you are good with manual focussing and use the tripod. BTW, the lens IS does work in video mode.I will edit this review as I play with this camera more. The 18-135 lens is nice but a bit large. Maybe its large thats why the image quality is very good."

This body is rock solid and worthy of purchase for ANY and ALL people entering or needing an advanced DSLR camera. I purchased the body only - I have several lenses from my previous Canons which are NOT currently 'IS' lenses. I've been shooting people, places and other things for more than 45 years and LOVE this camera. It's extremely mobile. I can just flip open my tripod lock and GO! My only issue with the T3i concerns the GRID functions. These work only in LIVE VIEW MODE (as I've found so far). As soon as you move up to manual for full control, you lose the grid (I use the 3x3), which helps me set my composition. Yes, I can use my eye to place an imaginary grid in the viewfinder, but WHY when one is readily available.With my additions on the camera already, video/image reviews will be plentiful. As I learn new tricks and shortcuts, I'll inform the public so they too can enjoy ALL of the features of this outstanding camera. The articulating screen wasn't necessary, yet it IS what made me choose this model over the T2i. The prices were just too close to pass it up. I'll be adding more T3i and T2i cameras to my photo biz in the coming months, as well as trying out the 'IS' lenses. This camera is very tight on power consumption and has extreme accuracy when you set it for pinpoint focusing as I do for model and portrait photography work. The macro features are also on par with its more advanced (and WAY higher priced), big brothers to this camera. Now, the 18.1MP sensor.....WOW! The image sizes of the CMOS sensor allow me great latitude in adjusting and tweaking my RAW images anytime I wish to be creative. If you are just starting out, are bored with the out of date 'point-n-shoot,' want to upgrade your digital cams, or you want to move from film to digital, the T3i will not disappoint. It's an excellent camera for ANY level of photographer - beginner or experienced pro, this camera really shines. Oh, and the video.....It's 1080p HD, nothing more needs to be said.

I shot some pictures during the day, played with the awesome depth of field and got some outstanding pictures.  Great contrast, color, white balance, exposure, everything was perfect.  It was actually difficult to get a bad photo even on the more manual settings.Where I was really shocked was low-light performance.  I got pictures I had never thought I could ever get without using the flash.  Even at 3200-6400 ISO I was amazed by the clarity, balance, detail and noise level.  Yes, you can see the noise, but in my humble opinion I actually like a little noise, to me it gives it a little cinematic flare, but that's just me.  But in my old TZ5 I had to severely decrease the shutter speed so much which made it almost impossible to get a clear shot, and even if I could get a clear shot it was either extremely underexposed, white balance was off, or the noise was just too much.  Again the T3i has excelled in every photo I have shot so far (200+).Even more amazing is when shooting 1080p video.  The exact same settings in photo mode will translate directly to video mode with the exact same results on screen.  It is really quite beautiful.  With the TZ5 shooting 720p video, I had to re-adjust the white balance, exposure and aperture for video, and it was still hit-or-miss which was sometimes painfully discovered late after reviewing the footage.  The T3i also has a standard mount and Microphone input and I was able to immediately mount my microphone for great audio.I'm probably a little biased because this is my first DSLR, so I can't really make a comparison with other DSLRs but I am certainly in love with this camera!  The most difficult thing about this camera is trying to decide which shot to choose from as every shot is perfect."

I'm starting photography school in just a few weeks and had to have a camera with video (oly e30 did not).After reading review after review, I decided to go with this wonderful camera. I'm so glad I did! I never thought I could get the colors out of another camera like I could my Olympus, but the image quality is excellent. I'm a female and the camera fits my hands perfectly. Another rave is that the controls are so easy to find and adjust, BIG plus for me. It was basically down to three cameras for me, the 7d, nikon 7000 , and the T3i. After taking many test shots in the store and getting a feel for the camera, this one won me over.The only complaint I have is that I wish it had a faster burst rate. I know the 60d is faster but after reading all the issues with that camera, it was off my list. Other than that, I have no other complaints.Buy it and enjoy it!Happy Shooting!"

This is my first DSLR and still learning to utilize its all features.... I went for this combination (camera and lens) because I am just an amateur photographer and don't want to swivel around lenses when i want to take pictures.. With this range (18-135) well, you can capture most of the things you want to capture, far and near..  I am pretty much satisfied with it.. but in the near future, i might as well get a 75-300mm lens.. ( I see pictures of moon taken by my friends with high range telephoto zoom lens and get jealous ! ). There are a few issues like the  video does not have auto focus and in the low light, AF takes time...In short, I am happy with my investment."

One of my favorite features is the flip out screen. You never realize how much you utilize it till you have the option.

But as far as >$1,000 HD cameras go, this is about as good as I've seen for an SD-Card video camcorder. The real bonus is that the recordings have a film look to them compared to the common flat 'video look'.There are multiple video formats and if you film at the 60 FPS video setting, you can actually produce some cool slow motion effects with a video editing program.Ease of Use:Pros will probably scoff at the large amount of newb presets, but at least everything can be controlled manually. newcomers and hobbiests like myself will like the time-saving presets. Do yourself a favor and read the manual front to back while the battery charges.Low light pictures:Images look great in high, mid, low, and really low light conditions.My only gripe...The Video mode turns off the viewfinder (since light needs to continuously hit the sensor), and the LCD is hard to see in bright daylight, so focusing can be a chore. But this is only a minor gripe.All in all, this is a GREAT camera for the beginner and hobbiest. It's also a very good back up camera for the professional. This is an easy choice to help you transistion from 'snapshot' cameras to professional gear and I've found the video capabilities to be remarkable for a an SD-Card format camcorder.This is a great camera for vacation pics and home movies and all at a great price!UPDATED: (1 Nov, 2011) I need to contradict my earlier review on the video results. This is an incredible camera for capturing 1080P HD video! I have an XH-A1 and after months of shooting video for my company, the T3i consistently outperformed the A1 in video image quality. Better resolution and richer (more accurate) color. Granted the audio isn't on the same level as the A1, but with an external mic, it's records a very clear single channel."

I have other EOS and Canon cameras. Digital and film.Wanted to try this new model as it had the flip out back which I wanted.The first day it worked great. Took some great photos.Next day, I went a few miles from home and took what i thought would be a great series of shots.  Never used the swing back as it was a very bright sunny day.  Just used the view finder.  It took photos...BUT...when I got home I flipped out the swing back to look at some of them real quick and discovered that there was an error code showing... Error 01  Failure of lense to communicate with camera.  Ok, fine...went to look at the photos I took and discovered I had no photos.  apparently the error happened immediately on me turning the camera on at the spot i took the photos.  I was not happy because you do not get an error code through the viewfinder if there is a problem..least not one that I saw.  Triedf to resolve the error code..as explained by support, and though nothing worked at the time, I continued trying different things and finally the error code disappeared and camera working. Ok, fine...next day...went to take some more photos..checked the screen.and the error code was back.  This time nothing i did helped.Contacted Canon support and was told to return the camera or send it to one of their repair centers. I called because on the Canon website when i clicked on their support icon for this model with lense since they dont have a listing for body only, I would get a screen saying that they were not repairing this model. Kind of strange.So am returning it to Amazon for replacement rather than sending it to the Canon repair center as I didnt want to wait possibly weeks. Amazon is great about it especially since I had it only a few days.  They are shipping a new one immediately which is fantastic and gave me a return label for return shipping for the defective camera.Not sure just what is wrong with this first one as I have never had a problem with any of my Canon cameras other than normal wear and tear over time.  So I was very surprised. But I guess with all the ones I have bought over the years, there was always the chance to get one with problems. This time, I did.  I still like the camera and I will always use Canon's.  Just diappointed that I am now having to wait a couple of days to get the new one before I get out taking photos with it.  I would still recommend it, buy which and gave 4 stars..but cant give 5 because of being disppointed at getting a defective one.I will update this review after I get the new one and see how it does.///////////////// OK, I RECIEVED THE NEW CAMERA. //////////////////////////////////////And have been using, also purchased the battery grip for it and extra batteries.First, the new one is great.  No problems and I dont have the error with it and my EF lenses. Though the weather hasnt permitted much outdoor photography for me, I was able to attend the photoshoot that I had had scheduled and because of Amazons wonderful service, I was able to use my new camera.  And it performed as I had nticipated.  It is as good or better than any of my other canon cameras. I am going to upload some photos shortly taken with this new camera.  Its a good camera.  Fast, sharp and easy to use. The controls take a little getting used to as placement is some different from my older canons. But once I was familiar with them it didnt take long to change settings or to switch modes or whatever I wanted to do.//////////////////Another Update //////////////////////////////////Been using it even more.  And the error code 1 has begun appearing again.  And after alot of discussions with Canon support, it seems that this new camera is not going to be compatible with so-called 3rd party lenses.  Right folks, if you have Sigma or Tamron lenses or otherss for the EOS system, then there is a good chance they might not work on this new camera.  Just wondering if this is planned?  Now in order to use this camera, I have to buy new lenses.  I have Sigma lenses and only one canon lense.  My sigma lenses arent cheap ones either.  So now, only canon lenses will work.  Not what I liked to hear.  Makes we wonder why.  Of course, its obvious when you consider the cost of 3rd party lenses compared to buying a canon brand lense.  3rd party leanses are alot cheaper in cost and at little difference in quality.More I find out, the more I am disappointed in this camera. I still like it, but am NOT happy at having to buy lenses just to be able to use it now. Not the camera, but Canon. Sigma is being great and as a long time customer is allowing me to trade my old lenses for new ones.  Still going to be out more money, but now where near as much as I would have//////////////////////////////// NEW UPDATE //////////////////////////////////Have gotten my new Sigma lens. Used it extensively testing it the last few days. It works perfectly.  No problems and am really happy with the images.  Very bright and color saturation is good.  Photos look great. I print mine on a Kodak printer which I am very happy with. My small prints anyway.  I have larger ones done by a specialty shop.Regardless, the problems seem to stem from the camera and older 3rd party lenses being incompatible in some way.  New technology...??  Very possible.  And likely designed in by canon.  They will fix any canon lenses to work with the newer cameras.  So what the change was...who knows.  I do know that Sigma does stand behind their lenses.  They have a program for long time customers, so if you experience problems, like I did, get in touch with them.  You will not be disapponted. Just dont expect something for nothing.  I didnt...and I love my new lense."
"932","XX","B004J3V90Y","5.0","32","36","July 12, 2011","AOZ6FDBL9EX4J","Less Is More","I've been a Canon customer since 1978, when I bought the 35mm Canon A-1, and I've had a Canon SLR ever since. Getting the new flagship model every three or four years was something I did for a long time, but when D-SLRs came along, I began downsizing after the EOS 1Ds I got in 2004. In 2007 I moved to EOS 40D and, although losing the full-size sensor was a sacrifice, it was a step in the right direction. With my recent purchase of the T3i, it's another move away from the professional models.Why would I do that? It's not so much the cost of new cameras that has shaped my decisions to downgrade; it's the size. While professional equipment is important to me, so are professional looking photos. And the truth is, after the newness wears off a D-SLR, I tend frequently to leave the big gun behind and rely on an advanced compact or ultrazoom for most of my shooting. As a result, I have more point-and-shoot pictures than I do pro quality ones.This tendency has ended with the purchase of the T3i. The camera is modestly sized, and I never leave home without it. With the 18-55mm kit lens (very nice little lens for its specs) or 24-105L, it's not any bigger than the Fuji Finepix HS10 I leaned on for most of my shooting this past year. And while the HS10 is hands down the best ultrazoom camera I ever used, the difference in image quality, performance and even video between it and the T3i is night and day.The T3i may not be blazing fast like my 1Ds or the 40D, but 90% of the shooting I do is not that kind of photography, anyway. What the T3i excels at is image quality. I have a whole raft of photos that, eked and tweaked to maximum effect in Photoshop, are only a little better than average because they were taken with a point-and-shoot camera. This camera's image quality, I'm happy to say, is superlative! So are the videos. Rebel T3i is almost too good to be true.An articulating LCD is something I've come to insist upon, and this one is by far the best I've ever used. I don't use Live View every time, but I've certainly been in that mode a lot more frequently with this model than with the 40D! In review mode, the refresh rate is a bit slow when zooming in to look at details, but it's not as slow as reviewing pictures on, say, Panasonic DMC-ZS7. (I did test Canon EOS 60D at Best Buy and noticed that the refresh rate is much faster on that model--perhaps because of the larger battery--but it's really not enough of an issue to deduct a star.)The resolution of the LCD is superb, and because it can be tilted and twisted to advantage, it can be viewed even in strong sunlight.Although the nine-point autofocus system is getting criticism for lagging behind Nikon, focus is swift and accurate. At 3.7 fps, burst mode is cut nearly in half from my 40D's 6.5 fps, but so far this has not hampered my ability to catch fast moving subjects.I appreciate the Lighting Optimizer function and use it a lot under the harsh lighting conditions in the desert where I live. It is of incalculable value.I have yet to haul out the owner's manual, thanks to the on-board guide. Of course it helps that I've owned Canon D-SLRs before, but adjusting settings on this camera is a lot different than on my previous ones. There have been some settings I would have normally needed to consult a manual for, but it hasn't been necessary because the answers are in-camera. (I never shoot in Auto, by the way. I'm a manual mode kinda gal.)Because images are very clean up to ISO 1600 and are usable even at ISO 6400, taking along the Speedlight flash so far has not been necessary. Yet another plus with this Canon iteration.There's something about blown highlights that really sets my teeth on edge, but that has not been a problem, thanks to the T3i's Highlight Tone Priority function. Dynamic range is very good to excellent, even a hair better than my 40D. Colors are more accurate, too. I prefer the contrast one stop under the camera's default setting, which is, admittedly, fairly punchy and will result in a blown highlight here and there. Reducing contrast just a tad fixes that.Eighteen megapixel resolution is outstanding.Sometimes I think about the EOS 60D's speedier performance, more advanced autofocus system and that wonderful electronic level and wonder if I made the right choice. But then I remember the heft and bulk of that camera and all the times I've left my SLR at home for those very reasons, and I know the T3i was the right decision. I really, really like this new camera--and I take it everywhere!"

But recently, at an engagement party, I was using my trustworthy Canon Powershot and when it came to photos, for every one photo I took, my friend with his T2i was take 10 or more.  And even indoors, his pictures looked great!Because I travel and cover so many events and there are times where our photographers are busy covering things, I figured...It would be great to have a DSLR.  I was at E3 and using my point-and-shoot, I knew right then and there, it was time to get a DSLR. I've been wanting to get one but frankly, the thought of me having to invest in the camera and several lenses and knowing they are not cheap...  I hesitated.But no longer.  It was time to get a DSLR!I have to admit....I was struggling between a Nikon 5100 or a Canon T3i (EOS 600) or even considering going a little higher-end.But I've read from professionals who say, 'It's the glass, not the body' and even our photographers, some of them are still using DSLR's made in the early 2000's and are quite content with the body, just focusing on the lens.For me, I wanted the best of both worlds of having something to shoot photos and video.  While I was close to getting the Nikon, the video review on digitalrev was enough to convince me to go for the T3i (EOS 600) and for its price range, I was comfortable with that.  Maybe in the future I can get something high-end but for now, I need something entry-level and with the T2i having dropped in price and selling out online and at stores, I noticed the T3i can be found and sure enough, while there are a few more technical things that it has compared to the T2i, for me, the swivel lens was something that I liked.  Especially for shots that require taking photos from weird levels and angles.  So, that was a plus for me!Upon opening the box, I realized that the T3i felt good but the higher-end cameras were more to my liking and are much more tougher.  But I figured, you get what you pay for and with the T3i, I just need to make sure I take care of it.WHAT YOU GET:I bought the version with an EF-S 18-55 IS II, so I got the lens with the two caps, inside are also the USB cord to transfer images and the Canon EOS Digital strap.  Instruction booklets, warranty registration and more.SO FAR, SO GOOD:Since owning the T3i, I have put this camera through hardcore use in a short amount of time.  Different events, different weather and have purchased quite a few things for this camera.If there is only one thing that I WISHED this camera did have was an easier menu to change things.  Aperature or Shutterspeed.  Granted, higher end models may have a display right at the top but looking at the LCD, definitely read the manual and experiment how to change various settings and experiment how you can change on the fly.And here are my thoughts that will definitely be different recommendations from others but it works for me:*  Get a good prime lens - 50mm 1.8 (preferably a 1.4) Canon lens.  I have the former which works great for portrait shots but I know already that the 1.4 works much better...it's also several hundred dollars more.*  Third party - I went third party for batteries, grip, hoods and they work perfectly.  I know there are diehards who purchase official Canon products but they are expensive and if you want to save money, look toward third party products.*  Read the Manual - I know there are people (like myself) who are impatient of reading manuals but in this case, read the manuals, especially those Canon-based brochures of lenses they recommend.*  Lenses - L lenses are great if you can afford them but if you can get yourself some Canon glass with image stabilization, this works great for entry-level photographers!  But if you are in it for the video, you want to get better glass!*  Research and Flickr! - I did a lot of research before buying this camera and for the most part, camera sites have all been positive. But definitely do your research.  I call my photographer friends and staff with questions but seriously, I learned that they are used to their high-end cameras and used to their lenses that they can give you some advice but it's best to experiment on your own but also go on Flickr and study other photographers, look at their exif data and get an idea of what lens they shot, what aperture, what shutter speed, etc.  And try to experiment with those settings.  Granted, lighting and setting is different but it's good to research and see what others are doing and what they were able to capture and knowing what lens they use.*  Last - Shoot Raw and consider purchasing a 10-speed, 16-32GB card.  Shooting at RAW gives you more options when using software like PhotoShop or Lightroom but you definitely want to shoot at RAW.  Nothing wrong with shooting via JPG, if you can manually fix those images on your own but I regret going to one event and shooting in JPG...I wished I shot RAW.  Now I do most of the time.  I say most of the time because I am in the process of purchasing a 32GB card (10-speed) and I have shot RAW 90% and 10% of the space, shot in JPG.JUDGMENT CALL:The T3i definitely delivers in picture quality and video.  Granted, if you have another $1,500+ to spend and money is no object...then go for the higher end Canon DSLR's.  But if you want to spend under a $1,000 but want very good quality for photos and video...the T3i is great!  There is not a humongous jump in features vs. its T2i brother and for some, the T2i may be enough, in fact, if you are not planning to shoot video, some people may want just the XSi which I still see people using and have taken great pictures with it.But for me, the extra features that I saw with this camera, I have seen the potential that I can utilize in different settings of event coverage that I go to.  If there is one thing that I wish I had...better lenses.  The kit lens is a good entry level but at 18-55, there are times when I needed to switch to the EF75-33 (f4-5.6 III) and I see that my photographer had the convenience of having an 70-300mm f/4-5.6 IS USM Lens and saw how it would make my life easier to have such a lens.In fact, I really like the IS (image stabilization lens) and now looking towards those lenses for my T3i.  The kit lens is good but you will definitely want a good zoom!  And also, I felt that using the cheap Canon 50mm 1.8 gave me more vibrant photos and better bokeh than the 18-55mm that came with the kit.As for video, the mic on the T3i is not the best, so you may want to consider purchasing a mic (one person I know uses a boom mic, another uses a mic that attaches on top T3i).  Taking video is very good but once again, if you are going for the T3i...plan to invest in larger GB cards...8GB is very good but I'm learning that I need more than that!  You may as well if you do cover events or take a lot of photos.While the menu interface could have been better, part of the convenience that Canon does give to those who spend more money...so, for under $1,000...the T3i is still a great deal for the quality it gives.I love this camera and I'm still learning as I go but so far so good! I still have yet to buy a Speedlite Flash (I do have an older Canon Speedlite from the late '70s (which I have used on a Canon A-1 SLR) that does work with the T3i but rather purchase something more modern.  And a few other things but for now, I'm just enjoying the pictures I take (and not enjoying the pictures I take, which is part of the learning process) but I'm quite content and happy that I bought this camera.If anything happens 6 months or a year down the line, I will definitely update this review."

First of all this is a very economical good sized, & comfortable great feeling camera.. very powerful HD 1080p video & picture effects. Very easy to use, can use for a point & shoot right out of box. That's not really why I bought it, I bought this after doing a lot of research 6mths prior to buying. Even though I had in mind what I was going to purchase. I did'nt see or read reviews on this until the end of April 2011. So this had'nt been out much longer than that. This seemed right a way everything I was looking for in a slr camera + more. If you don't no how to use this, as soon as you turn it on there is information on lcd screen which ever dial mode you use right there... so for the beginner this is just great. I already have some knowledge of camera's. The dof on this camera is amazing along with other things you can do to manually control what you're looking to achieve in pictures & movies. I have some very professional depth of field shots off this camera. The t3i came out with the flip out LCD screen in which works great when filming or taking pics high or low from eye level. The camera before this one was the t2i, which did not have the flip out screen. This also has good 3x to 10x zoom you have to set up if you choose to go that route, I use this on occassions, so it's good to know you can do this. You do need extra batteries & lenses that will make this such a professional camera. The battery grip is another option that I personally needed & suggest to add more time to battery life, this doubles a single battery use. I feel this camera is best used in as much manual control as possible, the automatic functions are great... but ( OH ) the depth you can get into using manual control is never ending. I've takin some very breathtaking photo's on some half dead flowers outside my house & this camera made these flowers look so professional, I'm blowing up some of these to 19 by 24 photo's & you would have never known this was takin from half dead flowers... we are going to hang these up on our front entrance way to dining area. There is so much to the canon eos t3i, I can't even attempt to tell how much fun I'm having & purchasing more accessories with it... This was a great choice... Highly Recommend... A+A+A+A+."

I've been able to get great images shooting in aperture priority mode...and the learning curve was pretty short given my previous experience with both Canon SLRs and high-end digital point and shoots. The T3i has a nice grip, good battery life (but be sure to get yourself a couple extras anyway) and the flip out screen is great when you're shooting product photos on a low tripod, which I do a lot of.My only complaint is relatively slow auto-focusing in live view mode, but it's a minor annoyance."

I purchased an extra battery, remote and Tamron 70-300 lens, digital card, and two polarizing filters for the two lenses. Everything came promptly and in great working order. My wife and I had just finished re-landscaping our backyard with waterfalls, ponds, many varieties of flowers and flowering shrubs, and then invited our children and grand children for the 4th of July celebration. I expected the Ti3 to be amazing and it is. I made quite a jump from the fixed lens Canon Powershot professional 8 mgp. It was like entering a whole new world of photography! My experience with the extra f-stops, ISOs, lens stabilization felt like being let out of jail! The photos came out of camera requiring minimal tweaking in Photoshop; a real time-saver! I was very pleased with how well the built-in flash worked (the one that came with the PS Pro was feeble at best). I have a Canon 430 Speedlight and never needed it once, but as I begin to take more time with flowers and other macros, I look forward to using the Speedlight as a wireless flash. The most pleasant surprise, though, was the performance the Tamron zoom lens. WOW! Sharp at all focal lengths. I opted for this lens over the newer Tamron 18-270, which is considerably more compact, but the reviews showed significant compromise in sharpness as it zooms out. Although the 70-300 is BIG, it isn't too big, and it makes great photos! This was my retirement gift to myself. While I retired in January, I took my time on this purchase and glad I did.  Look, this was a great shopping experience from top to bottom. The Amazon website handled half the order directly but coordinated perfectly with the other three purveyors. Everything shipped and delivered on schedule. AND, I used $200 worth of points from my Amazon/Chase credit card against the purchase. It felt like family!"

One of the problems with digital cameras is that you cannot see the picture in bright sun. Problem solved with tilt screen and with view finder. My lens from my Canon Rebel 35mm camera work well on this camera. Wish I had bought camera without lens because I never use the one that came with camera. It is good for taking pictures inside since it has image stabilization but you need longer lens for outdoor shots across the baseball field. It you do not already have lens you will enjoy having the one that comes with camera. Very, happy with camera. It has more features than I will ever learn to use."

Thank you Canon.","I want this review to help those who appreciate good quality pictures and videos to capture family moments that can be viewed back without saying ' I wish the pictures were crisper and more colorful'. I am an avid home photographer with no desire to learn any more about my camera than to take pictures in the 'auto' mode that comes with cameras.I've always kept a Canon point and shoot and a Sony video cam (~2005) since my first child was born, and have great photos/videos marking many milestones. I held back from upgrading my DV Video cam to a HD video cam knowing that soon enough (2 years?), I would find a single device to take with me that does pictures and HD video. I started looking into such devices in 2010. I was glad I saw the Sony NEX 5 that had high reviews on dpreview.com. Went with it for Christmas when I had my favorite extended family members and their kids with me for the first time with my new born. It was meant to be a season to remember. Guess what? The pictures were too soft when compared to my previos Canon point and shoot. The HD video was better than my Sony DV camcorder though. But the pictures left me 'wishing'. Kept it for a couple more months while checking dpreview.com if new products that did pictures and HD video were out. Then came across the Olympus PEN EPL2. Sold my Sony Nex 5 for half-price and went for the PEN. Even with the PEN, I was found 'wishing the pictures came out better'. There were no other products that I wanted to try as I slowly was losing hope for one camera that did it all. Then came the Canon T3i.BOY! AM I GLAD I BOUGHT IT! This is a regular DSLR and bulkier than the Sony Nex 5 and Olympus E-PL2 which are Micro Four Thirds. But the pictures and video immediately delighted me. The colors were nicely reproduced. The flash lighting in indoor shots was excellent (a main draw-back with the Sony NEX 5 and Olympus Pen E-PL2). Most family shots are indoors and a good flash is necessary.I can say that I have stopped wishin for good pictures and instead enjoy the beautiful pictures from the Canon T3i with the kit lense. My search for a product that does both stills and video with great quality is complete."

I went to Best buy and tested out the Canon T2i, the Nikon D5100, the Canon 60D, and the Nikon D7000. After testing out all the products I came to the decision that the only cameras I liked that felt good in my hand were the Canon T2i, Nikon D5100 and the Can T3i. I went for the T3i over the T2i because of the articulating LCD screen. I personally preferred the Canon T3i over the Canon T2i because of that one reason only, which is not a huge deal. The reason I chose the T3i over the Nikon D5100 was because of video manual focus on the Canon and also the Nikon D5100 does not have a built-in focus motor. I am sure the Nikon D5100 is a spectacular camera and it sports a larder image sensor than the Canon. I just felt in my opinion that the Canon T3i was the best deal at $789.99 with the lens kit.I took the camera out to the beach and tested it and was amazed by the Canon T3i quality. I literally took a picture of a surfer 75 Yards away with the kit lens, and was able to zoom in, in Photoshop and crop an up close beautiful detailed picture of the surfer. The quality is amazing I am upgrading from a Canon XSI and love it. I also took a picture of a cherry tree that was about 30 yards away, and then opened it up in Photoshop, zoomed in, and could see cherries that I could not even see with my eyes from the spot where I took the picture. I can not wait to get Canon 15-85mm f/3.5-5.6 EF-S Zoom Lens and than I will be in some serious business."

This is my first dSLR camera and I might as well have never been taking pictures when I had my point-and-shoot.  I wanted a camera that was capable of actually taking useable pictures indoors and also have a touch of zoom on it.  This does both great.  I can't believe the quality and clarity indoors, even at night.  With hardly any lights on it can take crisp photos with ease.  I was able to zoom across a dimly lit 40-foot room, use the flash, and read the serial numbers off my camera's box!  Amazing.The standard flash seems to work pretty well.  I'll probably get an external flash eventually, but the one it comes with works great.  Seems to be pretty powerful.  I haven't tested it outside at night yet, though.I've only played with the video capabilities briefly.  You set it up by finding your focus point and then roll from there.  It keeps the focus well and only small adjustments are needed when depth in your focused subject changes.  Might take a little work knowing when and how to change the focus during some action shots but eventually the non-autofocus throughout the video could end up being a positive rather than a negative due to customizing capabilities.The camera seems solid, but very light.  I couldn't believe the difference between this camera and my dad's 60D (which had a smaller lens on his as well).  It seems significantly lighter.  I thought this was a great feature since I'll probably use the camera a lot on the go.The functions of the camera make sense.  While I'm just a beginner, there seems to be a lot of room to learn with the camera.  The ease of use is easy enough for my wife to follow without having to learn all the intricacies to shooting a manual shot.  Yet all the manual capabilities are there when you want it.The live view screen is large, bright, and crisp.  Very easy to read in any light setting.Overall, I LOVE the camera.  While I would probably love any dSLR just coming from a point-and-shoot, the features of this camera are what attracted me to it.  It is light, powerful, and easy to use with flexibility to grow.  With such a powerful sensor for pictures and 1080p video capabilities, I feel this camera will be in my bag for many years to come."

I had my P&S for nearly 10 years (Canon of course), and I finally decided to take that leap into the big boy cameras. And I have to say, the T3i was truly the best pick for a beginner DLSR-er. My other option was the 5D Mark II, but it would have been too hi-tech for me (plus it does not come with a built-in flash), and not to mention $1200.00 more expensive.The Canon T3i is a perfect START for anyone who is not already familar with the DSLR cameras.The shutter sounds will need some getting used to, and auto-focus as well.I carry my camera everywhere I go, the pictures are fantasic. I would recommend getting a really good SD card to keep up with the camera. i.e. the Extreme III 32GB, which is much cheaper on Amazon than anywhere else. There is also the Extreme sold at local Best Buy's 16GB, which was the 1st upgrade from my basic point and shoot SD card class 2. Go with class 10 all the way."

That said, I always had higher end point and shoots, and frequently put them in manual mode and such. As such, I am not comparing against competing models or lenses, just on what I see after upgrading from a point and shoot. Anyway...I have had this camera for about a week now and have taken a few thousand shots. I am absolutely blown away by the quality. After using the T3i, I feel like I have never actually owned a camera- all my previous cameras seem like useless toys. The control and ability that this camera gives you allow you to really take your pictures to the next level. I took outdoor action shots of my dog that I wouldn't even have attempted in the past. The colors that popped in my outdoor shots really captured my neighborhood in spring bloom. One somewhat unpleasant surprise is just how much detail was picked up- skin blemishes and dust in my house were all very visible! This camera will allow you to capture moments that you can frame on your wall forever, as opposed to the typical posed portraits that you are generally limted by with point and shoots.I upgraded to the 18-135mm lens, and it takes great shots and never requires you to dance around getting closer to a subject. The lens feels solid, and is not excessively large. I live on a bay, and was able to get nice shots of boats 1/4 -1/2 mile away without a problem. I also picked up the Canon EF 50mm f/1.8 II lens for indoor photography. For the $125 price, it is a great deal and takes considerably better indoor shots with lower light."

For a period of two weeks, I had both cameras in my possession, so I could make a direct comparison, and decided hands-down that the T2i is the one I will keep.  Why?  The T2i is FAST.  I shoot my toddler in continuous mode, and the camera delivers the 3.7 fps it's supposed to.  It makes a huge difference knowing you can press the shutter and the camera will instantly take a picture.  The T3i, however, adds frequent and unpredictable delays when 'busy' flashes in the viewfinder and the red light is on -- even in continuous mode.I used the same exact settings on both cameras (large Jpeg, P-mode, Quick AF).  Compared to the instant responsiveness of the T2i, this was plain annoying and caused me to miss numerous shots.  I used the same class 10 SDHC chip in both cameras, but -- this is interesting -- even without any memory chip in the camera, the delays are still there."

Pity there aren't enough lenses for it but that could change soon.The Canon T3i comes with the best lens in the market, far better than the D5100 kit lens. The Nikon kit lens is a soft lens, the Canon kit lens is ultra-sharp and it has a greater depth of field. Also Canon lenses are cheaper.Color reproduction is noticeably better on the T3i. The Nikon camera lacks saturation, specially in the red spectrum. Sunsets look completely wrong on the Nikon, dull and grey instead of yellow and red. However the Nikon D5100 performance in ultra low-light conditions is spectacular, the D5100 noise reduction is impeccable and beats the Canon Rebel by a long shot. This make the Nikon a better choice if you plan to use super-telephotos or shoot at night.The T3i photos look amazing as long as you keep your exposures between ISO 100-800 but the Canon T3i responds poorly at ISO 6400, no just noise but white 'hot pixels' ruin the image. Photoshop filters can remove some of the noise but are unable to remove the white pixels successfully and who wants to work that hard anyhow? For this reason I cannot recommend this camera for low-light shooting such as wedding photography (ie. inside a church)Warning to filmmakers: It is not impossible to shoot a movie with the Rebel T3i but it is extremely impractical and I question the sanity of people who would recommend DSLR cameras for movie production. You would be just asking for trouble. Instead, if you must shoot HD video with a still camera for some reason, just buy a Sony TX9 or TX10 for one third of the price, the 1080p video quality is the same and it offers continuous autofocus, oh, and it fits in your pocket, perfect for traveling."

I'm happy with my choice so far, having purchased the camera first of all to take high quality photos of fairly small works of sculpture art, using the Canon 60mm macro lens.  For that use, the camera and lens seem to work very well.  I find the ergonomic arrangement of controls on the camera to very very intuitive and pleasant to use.  The camera feels solid and is easy to hold with the very adequate right hand grip that has a rubberized cover allowing the user to maintain a firm grip.  The menu system for adjusting camera settings is also well designed and easy to use. The adjustment wheel just behind the shutter button makes changing settings very simple when in manual mode. I especially like the articulated LCD screen on the back of the camera that allows it to be positioned so that otherwise very awkward camera positions (ie, overhead, or low to the ground) are easily possible.  The view finder is very clear and has all basic settings info on the bottom border.  The camera comes with a comfortable, good quality neck strap and is quite light and small compared to other SLRs. Battery life seems to be very good - longer than I expected.  The included corded battery charger will appeal to some, but not to those who prefer the travel type charger with a swing-out plug.  This is not a professional level SLR, but it performs very well as a small, light APS-C camera."

My wife and I wanted to start learning advanced photography and move-up from our point-and-shoot Canon Digital Elph 8900.First we were thinking Nikon, but I can safely say after experimenting with most Nikons that you wouldn't understand half of what the camera can do.Then the salesperson showed us this camera, the T3i. I loved the built in 1080 video, adjustable screen, and most importantly, the fact that Canon has made it extremely easy to use.Each mode has a 1-2 sentence explanation on the screen telling you when you'd want to use that mode. What I also like is that it's not too basic; meaning, you won't outgrow it right away.Granted I've only owned mine for a few days, . . . so far, I can say that you should absolutely strongly consider this model if you're in the same position that my wife & I have found ourselves in."

The camera is awesome so far. Very happy with the purchase, and look forward to learning about better photography.Recommended as a first-time DSLR, the T3i has ample features. There is so much to do with this camera. As soon as I learn one feature, it's on to the next exciting one. Takes gorgeous photographs. Just last night, I took some outstanding low-light shots that were exciting for a newbie like me, and would not have been do-able with a standard point-and-shoot.I really like the swivel on the live view when doing video clips, which was another reason I chose this camera over competitive models. You can use the live view to shoot stills as well, but I'm trying to learn the manual features and the viewfinder to get better acquainted with the camera. Just an FYI, you will need an SDHC card with a Series 6 rating or higher to do video. You can get a 16GB card on Amazon for a reasonable price.The stock lens seems to be fine as I am learning to use the camera. I plan on upgrading the lens once I get more comfortable with it. Again, there are some good values on Amazon for Canon lenses (just search 'Canon Lens' and you'll see the most popular buys).In closing, I took a long time to research and decide whether or not getting into a DSLR was worth it for me. Having now made the purchase, I can say without hesitation that it was well worth the money. Especially for a beginner like me, the T3i is a great camera."

This, then, is a review from a mom/amateur's point of view.MY GOALS/EXPECTATIONS:I have always been a photo fiend, taking my camera everywhere and pulling it out at any opportunity. While I'd gotten to a decent level of archiving important moments with my point-and-shoot cameras over the years, I wanted to take my photography to the next level. I was inspired by my brother-in-law's photos of his kids to take the dSLR plunge. But I knew (and still know), very little about professional photography. I wanted to start taking better photos right away. But I also wanted to have room to grow as a photographer and a camera that would grow with me.I also wanted the focus to stay firmly on my family - while I was willing to invest some time and care into the camera, I didn't want it to become like a pet I had to constantly watch over. While any dSLR takes some care and consideration, I've found the T3i has been an excellent camera for me and I've been quite pleased with it.PROS:* VERY USER FRIENDLY: The auto mode (or auto without flash, my favorite) is highly forgiving, taking fantastically sharp images, true to color. They look so clear that I feel I'm capturing as close to real life as I've ever seen before in a camera.* FAST: While I sometimes go in for trying out new modes and manual settings, I often leave the camera in auto or auto-sans-flash mode and just click away so that I can at least capture a moment before it's gone. I then play with manual settings if my kids stay still long enough for me to try something new. My previous cameras always had a horrible delay for the autofocus (the only mode they usually had), meaning I nearly always lost the moment when the toddler was on the move. The t3i is so ridiculously fast that I can snap multiple pics in the time one picture took before.* BEAUTIFUL PICTURES: This kind of goes without saying at this tier of camera, but the pictures are just amazing quality. Coming from the land of point-and-shoot, I'm pretty blown away. And I know I'm only touching the tip of the iceberg for what's possible.* BEAUTIFUL VIDEO: This is the nice new feature of the t3i. I wasn't sure I'd want or need the HD video. But hey, when you've got it, you use it. I've gotten some amazingly clear footage of the kiddo playing in the park with daddy and I'm so glad we went for the model with that feature.* BIG, CLEAR DISPLAY: It's really easy to see what pics you've just taken and adjust your photo-taking accordingly. Just by seeing what I've gotten, I'm able to try again and improve a shot almost immediately.* CLEAR MENUS/ABILITY TO IMPROVE: The interface on this is so intuitive that I've been able to learn a lot without even cracking open the manual (though that manual is my new reading material). The entry point for a new user is just a step up from normal photography - the possibilities, however, are nearly endless.* NICE KIT LENS: For all that photographers get into new and better lenses, the kit lens on this is really nice and easy to use. I think it will hold us for a good long while before I get to be more of an expert. It gives me the range of zoom and focus I need for now.* EYE-FI COMPATIBLE: WOW. I cannot even tell you how much I love this feature. If you get an eye-fi card, your pictures can be set up to automatically upload to your computer whenever you are within range of your synched wireless network. My husband set up a SmugMug account and the eye-fi capabilities. I take pics to my heart's content while out on walks, in the park, etc., and come home, then leave the camera on (auto-shut off after 8 minutes) to upload the pics. I can then tag and sort pictures later at my leisure. For me, this is amazingly useful. I don't have to take time out of my day to upload the pics - the camera does that for me.* BATTERY LIFE (for common use): So far, the battery we bought for the camera lasts very well during normal photo-taking. It's just a standard Canon battery for the rebel line and it charges quickly. Even when taking pics like a mad-woman, it lasts through a shoot. HD video eats it up more quickly, so be warned. Still, I rarely run out of juice during the day so long as I pop the battery into its charger in the evening. However, uploading is another story (See below in cons).Those are just the first few things I love about this camera. Here, however, are the...not cons, really, just challenges:CHALLENGES:* dSLRs ARE EXPENSIVE, DELICATE, BIG AND BULKY:And parents have enough precious and delicate things to worry about - namely, the kids. No getting around it - you can't just toss a dSLR into a pocket and go. I'm in a quest for a good bag/carrying solution (heh, yeah, wish me luck with that.) and I'm trying to get used to having one part of my brain keeping an eye on the camera as well as keeping the majority of my focus on the kids. When I'm in photo-journalist mode, it's no problem, but switching back to mom-mode is the hard part. I've already seen the camera knocked onto the ground (a very short distance onto very soft ground, so it was okay, but still, the experience practically gave me a heart attack) and once, when bending over, I caught the toddler on the temple with the kit lens (She sobbed. I felt so awful!) This thing requires constant awareness to both the camera AND the kids when using it. I'm quickly adjusting, but if you're not totally committed to learning to use and love the dSLR, you may want to stick to really good point-and-shoot camera if you're a busy parent.^ That's the big one.* BATTERY LIFE (when uploading pics via eye-fi): Uploading pictures by eye-fi seems to eat the battery alive. It appears that the camera won't autoshutoff when uploading, so this morning, after a few hours of uploading big, glorious pictures to my SmugMug account, the battery finally ran out of juice. I wish there was a plug-in mode or some sort of docking-station I could plug the camera into when I return home. If it's only a few pics, they upload and the camera shuts itself off. But if it's a bunch of pics (and when the weather's nice and the lighting's good, I take a lot of pics), the camera requires a battery recharge just to finish uploading my pictures.* SWIVEL SCREEN WORRIES: I find that the swivel screen, while hugely useful, is something I constantly worry that I'm going to snap off. However, you can keep it closed with the screen facing in(a nice feature) or tuck it onto the camera with the screen facing out. I also find if I'm looking out of the eye-piece, I leave cheek smudges all over the screen when its facing out.* MANUAL-MODE GOOFS: Some of my manual mode forays have been less than stellar. I've taken a shot - set up so nice, focus just perfect, subject just so... only to find out I left it in white-balance adjustment for indoors and I was outdoors so the whole picture looks like I dipped it in blue. I've learned to take pics in auto-mode first before experimenting too much. I also learned to check the screen a LOT before proceeding.SUMMARY: While the dSLR has required me to make some adjustments for including it in my busy life, I really love this camera, am pleased with the investment, am inspired by its ease of use, and I LOVE the pictures I've gotten of my family.5 STARS: And so I give it 5 stars - my whole point in buying a nice camera was to make and preserve FAMILY memories - and the t3i records those memories beautifully - in .jpg, raw, or HD video - with a minimum of dSLR fuss.*** UPDATE: about 6 months later ***STILL AWESOME:  I totally stand by the above review. If anything, I've come to adore this camera even more than I did when we first got it. When baby #2 arrived, the quality of pictures that we got far surpassed the pictures from the first baby's photo shoots. I'm truly pleased with this investment, as the pictures we get are lovely, clear, true-to-light/true-to-color, and just capture the memories so well. Really, this is EXACTLY what I was hoping for as an amateur photographer/mom.GOT BETTER:Battery Woes: We invested in an A/C adapter for the camera and now no longer eat the battery alive when leaving the camera to upload pictures via the Eye-Fi connection. It's a little annoying to have to swap over to the A/C and then back to a battery all the time - I would rather have a charging station of sorts - but it works and it means I stick the battery in the charger so it's almost always ready to go.Ease of Use: I adjusted to using this thing pretty quickly. I invested in a LowePro FastPack 250 and it works nicely as a diaper-bag/day bag/camera bag. Not the most attractive purse, but it works well. I'm much better at being ready for any photo situation now.Swivel Screen: No problems to report. I just leave it screen out all the time.SAME: Awesome camera all around. Truly, truly impressive. There might be higher tiers of quality out there, but for what I use in following the kids around, this captures amazing shots quickly. Love it.GOT (just a little) WORSE:Eye-Fi Annoyance: This is going to differ from person to person, but our Eye-Fi stuff has had some kinks to work out. The card we bought required several updates lately, then we had to change SmugMug account stuff, but the changed password meant Eye-Fi couldn't upload. Blah, blah, blah, I'm sure most of the problem is ME not getting the changes my hubby made. Still, Eye-Fi is usually automatic, but from time to time, it requires maintenance and understanding from all parties uploading stuff. Just be warned, it isn't so automagical as I hoped it would be.Getting used to the dSLR bulk: I'd be lying if I said the size of the camera wasn't occasionally an issue. There have been quite a few times I think, 'Oh, where's the camera? That's right, I left it at home/in the car because it's kind of a pain to pack around.' On many occasions, the hubby's phone camera stood in for us (and it takes pretty decent pictures, so it's okay). But if I'm not being really deliberate about bringing the dSLR and using it, this camera becomes a very expensive toy that I never play with.Other than that ^ though, awesome camera. I'm truly loving it. On the whole, a Lotta camera for Low maintenance."

And one way they found to do just that is by making the camera make far more noise than it needs to when doing continuous shooting.There is a mirror lockup feature, and there is a live view mode which locks up the mirror, and there is a continuous shooting mode which better photographers will use especially in this day of essentially unlimited exposure memory. The mirror lockup is intended to minimize vibration by keeping the mirror in place when the shutter releases, but it will also keep things quiet during continuous shooting, where you are machine-gunning off tons of shots in rapid sequence.Sadly, this otherwise nearly perfect camera decides to flip the mirror up and down every single shot of a continuous sequence, and despite all those settings available, none of them are allowed to work. That makes this product embarrassing to use in a quiet space! What company wants to embarrass people for using their product?!?This is why people have created 3rd party firmware for these cameras called Magic Lantern. It's buggy and I don't know if it fixes this particular cripple but they might put it in if people ask. I have not loaded it into my camera but this sort of thing really tempts me.Otherwise this camera is totally awesome for the money. I would also like to be able to zoom in on the image preview (the view of your image that comes up right after you take the picture) which oddly was available on some of Canon's point-and-shoots from years ago. That would let me see quickly if I got sharpness. For video, I would like to be able to completely clear the screen of distractions...there is a white rectangle showing where zooming will happen that I can't seem to get rid of. I would also like to have the histogram available while I'm filming video, and an edge finder feature for focus (see some high-end Marshall LCD monitors).The Digital Zoom 3x-10x is bolted on, requiring a vulcan neck pinch to get going...I sense they weren't sure of this feature, there were bitter arguments about it, not least of which because it's explosive to their product line. Not only is it their only DSLR that offers it right now, I have done the tests and discovered that the 3x digital zoom avoids Canon's achilles heel of DSLR video: It no longer does line skipping when at 3x! This means that the aliasing and moire that dogs all Canon DSLR video at this time (they need to implement a simple anti-aliaser for video capture...c'mon guys) is solved on the T3I/600D as long as you are zoomed 3x. The reason is obvious, it's just using the center pixel sensors rather than the entire 18MP sensor...so it's only working with ~2MP natively and doesn't have to drop anything. This image is great, but when you multiply 3x time 1.6x crop sensor you need a very wide angle lens to work this way without line skipping.I am sure they are withholding anti-aliasing for two reasons: 1) they want to make it exclusive to their high-end cameras first, and those have a longer product cycle, and 2) there must be bitter acrimony within the company about the DSLR division eating the video division's lunch. Nikon et al. will eat Canon's lunch if Canon doesn't eat its own as lunch...that's why we have this great camera, and that's why Canon is going to have to serve us all with uncrippled products soon enough. Just bite the bullet and let the high end products sell themselves on their own intrinsic merit Canon!"

Let me just say excellent professional looking shots are pretty easy with this camera, and I highly recommend it to anyone thinking of purchasing an SLR camera.  I love the 18-135mm lens, as I'm usually just taking pictures of my wife and kid with it, seems as if I don't need any other lens.  Maybe just a nifty 50 and a separate flash for simple bounce/diffused shots. No regrets on spending the premium for the lens or the newest model! Woohoo, new hobby!"

Yes, I'm new, and YUP, its fast, accurate and the LCD w/o a doubt is clear, and super fun. My husband was drying our pretty Papillon, I was laying on the bed, taking pics upside down, why, cuz I could! I love how you can take pics at just about every which way your laying, standing, whatever way, its great! Since the SLR is new to me, I have some learning, but so far, it's GREAT. Images are super sharp, clear and despite I don't have a zoom lens, its pretty sweet. We had a nice sunset tonight, and images VERY crisp, and beautiful, along w/ the color.If this is your first SLR, Go for it!!!"

Its quality is amazing, and the on-board mic records great to me as well.  For anyone wondering about the new HD digital movie zoom, I created a video demonstrating its quality and the microphone quality as well!  Its on youtube.  Just search for t3i digital zoom and onboard mic test.  Check it out and let me know what you think in the comments!On a side note, I would not recommend purchasing the Patriot LX series 32gb class 10 SDHC card.  I ordered one of these from newegg and when I received it, it did not work properly with the camera due to old firmware on the card.  Patriot has confirmed this over the phone, as the issue started with the T2i.  Apparently they fixed it in there new cards, but old ones are still out there!  I did order the Transcend 32gb class 10 and it is currently working fine at the moment.I Highly recommend getting a wireless remote.  I picked up a brand called Shoot, here on amazon and works great for videos as well if you do not have anyone to operate the camera for recording.Also the battery grip here on amazon fits perfect on the T3i and gives it a nice solid feel and increases stabilization.
