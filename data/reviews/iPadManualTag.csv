After I set it up for her and learning  basic operating skills, I turned it over to her. My kindle is fine for my needs and I recommended that my friend purchase the new Ipad because of reliability and customer service. After checking the reviews on the other pads, I felt the Ipad 4 was worth the purchase and since my friend could afford it, why not?She took a while to navigate around her Ipad and thanks to her gal friend who has the same, she should have many hours of pleasurable usage. Personally, I find it too much for me when my laptop can do all, but there are those who need all the new things and I say enjoy."

Called Apple customer service and got someone with  poor English skills who's located in India. I told him numerous times that I just wanted to get my password in. $200 and over three hours on the phone still did not get a password on ipad. Pad will not let me have password so therefore I'm unable to use this Apple ipad. I feel like I've been  ripped off.Do you have any suggestions?"

"39","XX","B009W8YQ6K","4.0","3","6","October 10, 2013","A32LX4XJ2LU740","Great, but not a huge leap from iPad2","I own an iPad because it has business apps I use that are best used with a touch screen. One pros side, there's not much I can add to what's already been said. It is great and I'm glad I upgraded from an iPad 2 to iPad 4.But I'm deducting one star for the following reasons:Apple wants to upsell you from the iPad 2 to the iPad 4 mostly on this criteria:1) Siri. There's nothing revolutionary about it. For most it's answers it just spits out Google search results and then you do the rest. People are fascinated by it because it throws a few human-like colloquialisms.2) Retina display. I upgraded from an iPad 2. To quite frank, things do no all of a sudden jump out at you in iPad 4. Yes, I do like it. And it's very nice to be sure. But the Retina Display is just a name someone dreamed up that makes it sound more innovative than it actually us. High resolution is everywhere. It's just that Apple give it a snazzy name and suddenly, it's like the a new invention.3) 'A6 is 2x faster than A5' Huh? Reality check. This one is probably where I feel people are misled the most. To me the A5 is noticeably faster and that's nice. But in real life 'twice as fast' means 50 mpg vs 25 mph. Or flying from L.A. to Hong Kong in 8 hours instead of 16. To me the speed difference is more like flying from L.A. to Hong Kong in 14 hours instead of 16.All in all, there a lot of hype that used to make the iPad 4 sound like a quantum leap rather than the incremental improvement that it is. Thus we pay more for it.That said, I like it a lot, but mainly for the reasons that people have liked the iPad ever Steve Job unveiled on that big screen behind him...not because of these minor improvements."
