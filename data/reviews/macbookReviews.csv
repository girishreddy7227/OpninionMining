And mine had broke but I sent it in under warranty-no problems. So My sister and I again got new matching laptops-Toshiba Satellite. Under a year, The Corner where I open the laptop broke and Costumer service sucked. I called, emailed, and searched way to long just find where to send it. And I sent it in and got it back. Within like 4 months mine had broke again (out of warranty now) And I was done. My sisters same laptop broke about the month later for the same reason. I couldn't even open or close it. That defeated the whole point of a laptop. So I was done. I have wanted a Macbook for a while. And after me and my sisters multiple laptop problems I was willing to pay a lot to try Mac. I also thought it would be good now that I started College. I heard nothing but good things about Macs. I have been to the Apple Store for problems with my iPhone charging cord and it gets fixed, no problems, great service. And the warranty starts over when you get a new cord. I love that! And since I have a iPhone I get emails from Apple. I got a email for the Back to School Sale. I got educational pricing and Got this Macbook Pro 13.3 inch For $999. And Plus this promotion I got a $100 gift Card to the App Store. I thought that was the best offer I could get. So Me and My twin ordered it from the store. The gift card and the laptop came separately. And One thing I like was that when the gift card came, it did have a return address but it didn't say Apple so when people saw it they wouldn't steal the gift card. But You can tell that it was from Apple. When I opened the box for the Macbook, besides it having the charger for it, it had a extension to add to it. I didn't read anywhere that that was included but it is! I have been using the Macbook Pro for about 3 weeks now and I absolutely love it! I was new to the Mac system and It was pretty easy to use. The touchpad I was lost but I looked at videos on Youtube to figure out how to use the shortcuts and things. The software is fast. Laptop is comfortable, portable, and somewhat lightweight. Before I got the Back to School Promotion, I was thinking of getting the new macbook Air. But I wanted the Pro for the CD/DVD player. And since the educational pricing was $999 for the Pro, the original price of the Air, I decided on the Pro. I am using my Pro typing this. You can get the educational pricing all year long I saw. I did not know this when I bought it but that didn't change my mind that I wanted to get it anyway. I love how easy it is to use. Also I LOVE the feature of the light up keyboard. I use my computer for typing things and when I don't want to get up to turn on the light because I am focused or because I am to lazy, I can just turn the brightness up. I can close my laptop and when I open it, I type in my password and I am in within 1 second. My other laptops took like 2 minutes just to wake up. The battery Life on this laptop is AMAZING. Use like for 7 hours compared to the 2-3 hours of my other ones. I recommend this laptop for anyone! I will update later if any problems arise. ( I don't think any problems will arise)I do want to recommend that to save the battery, let the battery charge to 100% then unplugg it and let it totally die. Then Plug it back in. It makes the battery last long. :) I love my Macbook Pro! I hope it lasts me for years!"

I have had PC's all of my life and have been afraid of Mac's because I was always told they were mysterious and complicated. That could not have been further from the truth, it is just a different type of operating system that downloads programs in app form. I just look at it as a bigger version of my ipod touch, same concept (well at least IMO).The weight is a non issue for me, I am allowed to have a laptop in three of my four classes, so I only bring the laptop to school along with my tablet and for that other class a standard notebook. It suits me. I like the fact it has a optical drive, I don't care that optical drives are apparently on their way out and that apple now has something you can hook your other non optical drive mac's up too, I really like the freedom of not having to drag around another piece of technology and be able to use it whenever I want. This machine is solid, and built very well, call me old school, but with laptops I have always prefered solid and an optical disc drive.The speed is wonderful, the sound is so-so, but it makes up for the performance of downloaded films from itunes. On my PC, the downloaded itunes films tend to lag, so it's really wonderful to be able to watch something and not have it lag and then freeze and then catch up with the dialogue a minute later.One issue I do have is it does not seem to get along with my Google/Android devices (phone and tablet) that I have tried hooking it up too, does not regard them, nor bring them up. I guess I need a special program to be able to bring them up.All in all, a wonderful machine. Well worth the money."

But if you are migrating over to Apple to take advantage of the apparent bargains to be found in the professional software arena (Music Production, Video Production, Graphic Arts, etc.) I am issuing a warning that Apple is lying to you.  Apple has implemented an aberrant pricing policy that varies widely from the industry standard pricing policy for professional software.  Apple, in true corporate fashion, has made this change without warning or notice.  The new policy is NO PATH TO UPGRADE.  You heard me right.  If you pay professional software prices for a piece of Apple software, and two months later they release the new and improved package, you will be stuck paying full price for the upgrade.  Do you feel like you got a deal now?  You have now paid more for your software than if you had gone with the industry leading software package (PreSONUS, Adobe Premiere, CorelDraw, etc.) and next update, you will be well behind the pricing curve.  I do not have a problem with Apple software, but rather the sneaky way in which they implemented the pricing policy.  If you are buying Apple to take advantage of these apparent deals...save your money and stick with a PC.  You will pay more initially for your software, but within a year you will be saving money."

I wanted a more powerful laptop with an optical drive and lager screen (my old Air was a 2011 i5 baseline model). So far I am very pleased with my upgrade. I love photography, and Photoshop runs very well on this machine with the occasional lag. The Sims 3 also runs very well on this laptop, but after about an hours use the laptop becomes very hot. The added storage space is great considering I upgraded from 64 gigs to 500gigs. The only complaint I have with the machine is that when booting up the laptop after its been asleep causes a delay ranging from 15-40 seconds. This can be very frustrating when you need to get work done immediately. One feature I love is that the laptop syncs with my Powermac G5, so the need for a flash drive to transfer files between the two is gone!

There is a standard quality and consistency across the board, which other manufacturers cannot seem to provide. I am not really an Apple Fanboy!!!It's made by Apple so it must be sweet!! Actually the Macbook Pro is one sweet and rugged laptop....or is it a notebook?! The 2.9 MBPRO is a quick bugger and features the latest Mac OS. Apple quality and consistency clearly shows in the hardware and OS. Wintel machines are all over the place in terms of quality and consistency. Yes there are good machines but they cost nearly the same as a MBPRO.> OS: Mac OS vs W*ndows 8....seriously folks W*ndows Eight is crazy....confusing....buggy....slow?! Besides that you can run W*ndows on a MAC! Mac OS is solid all around!> Security: In all my years of using Mac OS...I have yet to encounter malware/virus issues. I have seen Wintel users innocently click on a site and end up with crazy malware programs or toolbars that bring along malware. When I clean/repair malware infections off Wintel machines - my head spins wondering how the user ended up with them!> Hardware design and quality: The MBPRO features a unibody aluminum chassis that makes it very rugged! I have a kid who uses his roughly and it remains solid. Wintel machines are usually plastic unless you go higher end.> Display: The 13' display on a MBPRO gives you the feeling that you are using a larger display. It gives you edge to edge real estate and is bright and sharp.> Keyboard/TouchPad: The MBPRO's keyboard is a backlit making it easier to see and type. The touch screen is smooth and razor sharp. Unlike many Wintel machines in which the touchpads go crazy at the slightest touch - the MBPRO's touchpad is a pleasure to use.Very quick and cursory review."

And you're making it so hard.The 13-inch MacBook Pro, back when it was simply called the MacBook, was a truly envy-inducing laptop. Debuting in the fall of 2008, it turned heads at coffee shops. It was the 15-inch Retina Display MacBook Pro of its time. No, it was better: it was the return, in a way, of the MacBook family to the more portable space once occupied by the 12-inch PowerBook G4.I digress because the looks of the 13-inch MacBook Pro haven't changed at all, really, since that fall. They haven't changed since last year, either. The 2012 MacBook Pro has newer third-gen Intel Core i5 and i7 processors, USB 3.0 ports, and better integrated graphics. That's it. The weight, the size, the battery life, and even the price remain the same. This is more of a spec bump than a new product. While the new 13-inch MacBook Pro is a little bit better than last year's 2011 model, the landscape for laptops is changing faster than ever.Windows laptops with similar components to the $1,199 13-inch Pro cost around $700. While the 13-inch Air has seen a price reduction, the Pro's continued status quo is all the more frustrating. Yes, the 13-inch Pro can be easily upgraded with more RAM or a larger hard drive or solid-state drive (SSD), and it has an optical drive and more ports, but it lacks the type of upgrades you'd expect on the higher, 'Pro' end: no discrete graphics, no quad-core processor options, and no screen higher-res than 1,280x800 pixels."

I had this problem with the last one, and after it served me 3 years I thought it was due a change, only to have the repeated problem on this model, after ONLY 18 months from from Date of Purchase. I started getting the Graphic card problem when Opening and Operating iPhoto and graphic intensive programs (Final Cut Pro, Final Cut x etc)...first it was a glitch, like a tv going bad which turned to a blue screen, now it just goes straight grey, and won't restart or run a Disk Utility.I am saddened by the fact this is the disgusting results I am getting after years of buying APPLE Mac Book Pros.In total this is my 3rd, having bought my first MBP, back in 2003 (whatever they called it then anyway) and that suffered the same problem too.As I only took the regular 1 year Warranty on this model, and not the extended Apple care, I am asking AMAZON to intervene here, or for APPLE themselves to intervene here.

My aging PC was misbehaving all the time -- cursor jumping, skipping to a new page without my initiating it, losing my work... so many times I would whisper to it, Mac...Mac...Mac...and finally I decided to do it.I love my iPhone, and because I was used to that, learning the Mac was very easy. The icons are the same and the way it operates is very similar. It is designed to be user-friendly. I was fully able to use it comfortably within an hour.I chose the 13.3 inch laptop because I thought that was a good size for me, and I chose the 8 gigabyte memory and more powerful processor because I think as programs and operating systems that need more power and memory come along, it will be adaptable and consequently will last longer. Another deciding factor in which version to buy was going to the Apple website and seeing what the 4 gig model with the less powerful processor would cost with double the memory. Their price turned for that out to be the same as the Amazon price for the one with the more powerful processor and the 8 gig memory.  I chose the one without retina display, and having seen both side by side at the local Mac store, I am really happier with the non-retina display model. I think the picture is actually sharper, in spite of what they say about the retina display.I am a writer and take some online classes, and it works beautifully for both. I can do my work and store it on the iCloud. It has an excellent sound system and will play CDs. That's another reason I chose this model rather than the Mac Air, which has no slot for CDs.Some things I don't like about it are lack of a way to delete the words or letters in front of the cursor instead of just the words or letters behind it, and not being able to play Cubis on it. (Cubis has never made a Mac version.) The things I love about it far outweigh this.The battery lasts for about 7 or 8 hours of continuous work and recharges quickly. I am really, really happy I got this computer."

Mainly bought a 15.4' MacBook Pro as my older 13' felt cramped for working with audio projects and using an external monitor often was getting tiring. With most storage products shifting to USB 3.0, I felt it was perfect timing to shop.Key highlight of owning a Mac is the iLife suite, iPhoto is still the leader of being a great photo album/management tool with some consumer friendly editing features, iMovie is the benchmark of easy to use video editing software and GarageBand went from being an audio recording platform for everyday users to adding more teaching lessons since '09. Out of the box you have a very nice ready to go creative machine.Hardware features:--15.4' screen(non-high res) is still great, I prefer 16:10 displays over the squished 16:9 displays. While I'm not a fan of glossy screens the way Apple designed the glossy cover over the screen it keeps the backlight from bleeding vs makers who put a glossy coating onto the screen panel itself. Viewing angle on glossy vs non-glossy MacBook Pros is better than most notebooks on the market.--Processor, I know my review at this point is already 'old' with Haswell(4th generation Core i) based computers reaching the market, Ivy Bridge(3rd Generation Core i) Quadcore easily crunches through encoding/decoding vs dual-core.--Graphics processor, this is the only reason you'll want a 15' MacBook Pro/Retina MacBook Pro is the nVidia graphics as it can handle running software which are GPU dependent(animation, editing software and gaming). I can admit if you plan to do light gaming, consider using Boot Camp to run Windows 7 as you're able to use the newest/better nVidia graphics drivers--Apple only updates graphics drivers with software updates or new OS releases so performance can vary.--Bluetooth, in an era where most computers have this optional, Apple has always made this standard on their notebooks since 2004. Often I use this to sync my phone contacts/calendars/to do lists.--USB 3.0, this was my 2nd excuse to get a new Mac. Backups and transfering large projects via USB 3.0 is much faster than past Macs with USB 2.0.--Thunderbolt, at the moment you're either seeing PCIe expansion solutions for audio/video professionals or RAID storage products. With USB 3.0 being cheaper, I'm starting to worry this will fall into Firewire territory of only select groups of owners actually use it. Beyond highspeed, most users will use this for a 2nd monitor.--Firewire 800, looks like this could be the last Mac with it built-in based on the direction Apple is shifting towards. I use audio interfaces with Firewire so this is important. Older Mac owners may also still use FW400/800 external hard drives.--DVDRW Drive, some of us still use/need the drive and wasting bag space to carry one isn't ideal.Overall this is the only option for an aftermarket upgradable portable Mac. I didn't bother making notes on the memory/HDD as I cloned the HDD to a WD Black 750GB and installed 16GB of memory. Since everybody has different work/lifestyle requirements, sooner or later you'll feel the stock 4GB of memory isn't enough."

The exterior is absolutely gorgeous. The backlit keyboard is a great feature not to mention the key spacing makes typing so natural and easy. I also like how the rear apple logo stays lit while the laptop is on. When connected to Wi-Fi the Internet runs blazing fast and the screen quality is bright and crisp. Even after comparing this model with the MacBooks with retina display the little difference I saw didn't seem worth paying several hundred dollars more. 500GB is plenty of hard drive space for my needs and later on I might upgrade to 8GB of DDR3 memory but for now I'm very happy with its performance. I know some PC fans are hesitant to switch to a different operating system but honestly it's very easy to get used to especially if you've owned other Apple products in the past (i.e. iPhones, iPods etc...) The one and only thing I would change to match that of the PC laptops is on a MacBook tapping the touch pad does not serve as a 'click' on a program. That's definitely a minor complaint so don't let my nit-pickyness discourage you. Sure MacBooks are a little pricey but take my word for it the investment is well worth it. These computers last on average 5-6 years which is way better than paying a little less and buying a PC laptop that is likely to break in a year. So if you're looking for a great laptop with amazing versatility get this one. You will not regret it."

Soft touch, anodized aluminum with laser cut precision and no flaws. I love the little rubber seam that runs all the way around the edge of the screen that protects the screen from being scratched by the palm pads of the inner side. The keys are durable, and only start to wear out (become shiny) after about 1,000,000 hours of continuous use. I have another 2008 Black MacBook That has seen the most lengthy writing sessions with much sweating upon, and the keys still feel as good as new. I don't like the fact that the Screen is a fingerprint and dust magnet, but I fix that by wiping the screen down as a thing I do every Saturday Morning. The paint indicators on the side of the MacBook indicating which port is which has slowly become rubbed out from abrasion, but I know what port is now, so its ok. I wish I still had the paint in case I needed to sell it. The fan exhaust is located right under the screen hinge, and since it is easily covered, the laptop easily heats up. The trackpad is as smooth as velvet. I wish it was a entire button, so the trackpad wouldnt have to bend down when you press it at the top, but I've gotten used to the old way of thinking and using my thumb as a button-presser.Software:I can't say muchI love Macintosh. Grew up with it from OS 8I love how seamless and flawless it is. I can't wait for Mavericks, and I know it'll be a bestseller.I really love the fact that Mac has an app store with its constantly growing database, and great games.I wish iLife came hooked up to your account as soon as you enter your apple id with icloud so you can update it as part of your app collection, but since it doesnt cost that much, its coolHardware:Apple always has bleeding edge performance and I love their support of everything out thereMy Mac rarely ever lags, and even when it does, (unless the fan is blocked), the fan is almost unnoticeable. I've heard that they fixed the problem with the new Retina Display MacBook Pro though with the adjusted frequency fans. I really want to try that out for my self.I also love the super fast Ivy Bridge 2.6 Ghz processor with Great battery life.They only fact that I wish they had done was refresh the ENTIRE Mac lineup along with the MacBook Air's when they changed the processors to Haswell.Overall:I love this product.I love appleJust wish they continued the color variety.I dont know how much effort it would take to make an anodized black macbook pro, macbook air, and a iMac, but if they did, I know that if they did, people would trip over each other just to get their hands on one of themI know I would.So until that happens, I'm sticking with this."

Long story short, I got it, and it was one of the best tech decicions I could have made.Operating System.Personally, I find the Mac operting system like nothing else. After switching to Mac IOS I could never go back to windows. Mac just runs clean and smooth: simple as that. It has a great layout for everything to be visible and accesible and that is key. With the app store, it is easy to geta hold of your favorite programs no matter the category of intent.HardwareI love how this is built with solid metal unibody because not only is it downright stronger, it gives the computer a more solid 'real' feel to it, and I think that really adds to the experience. Once you buy your mac, the customer service is great, should you ever need it.PersonalI use mine for academics so it is great for writing papers and typing notes. It is also great for the heavier stuff such as powerpoints and iMovie presentations which are easy to create on the Mac os. It has thousands of tiny but usable features built into it like a VGA port for tv's and projectors. Also software things like voice dictation and keyboard short cuts to make everything run smoothely. I have the 320 GB hard drive and 4 GB of Ram Mac, and I never feel like I am in need of more. Even when I am running Itunes/Imovie and my email and browser in the background it works smoothly like nothing is open. I also own a King fire HD and I use apps like dropbox and evernote to sync my notes, powerpoints, and papers between these 2 devices. The battery life is great. It will easily last about 2-3 schools days without needing I charge, however I charge mine every night because I like the security of having a full battery in the mornin, just in case I need to compute something out of the ordinary. I like the flat and easy type feel of the keyboard, this is especially nice when taking notes quickly because the keys are ellusive and pop-up very nicely. The speakers are good, however I almost never use them, because I prefer studio headphones for personal use. The backlit keynaord makes dorm night homework much easier. The fans are great for keeping the Macbook pro cool for normal uses, but for Gaming you might want to consider a cool pad because it can get a bit hot. I don't play computer games too, too often, thus don't have one.I hope this helped, I would adivse anyone on the fence between this computer and another of similair value to consider the macbook pro closely."

With an iphone, Ipad, Macbook pro and Apple router. I bought a Macbook Pro in July 2010 and bought an extended warranty for 3 years. Recently in July 2013 I had some power problems and I took it to the Apple store on August 8th, 2013. It was found that the battery needs replacement but Apple  refused to replace it because the extended warranty was over by a few days!Two things that mark the new Apple as plebeian and cheap as some other manufacturers - 1. The battery misbehaved exactly after the warranty expired, precise to the day!  2. Apple which earlier would have replaced the battery knowing very well that they sold me a 3 yr warranty that was not misutilized - would have replaced the battery. But they did not.Why pay a premium for Apple service? Furthermore, why buy Apple extended warranty?I chose not to replace my battery. My next machine will be .. not APPLE."

I've owned an iMac, Mac Mini, and now this MacBook Pro. All of which I have had great success with. However, apple isn't what it used to be. I've heard large production houses are slowly moving away from mac, but couldn't understand why. Now I know.First off, let me say that initial impressions of this were good, great look and feel, gorgeous display especially when calibrated, decent sounding speakers, and acceptable performance for 4gb RAM, a hard drive, and a dual core. It pretty much ends there.Over the corse of owning this computer (15 months), it has been to the apple store for repair 4 times, all relating to the main hard drive bay, the hard drive has been replaced twice, the cable once. I got tired of all of this shenanigans and decided to upgrade the thing myself. Bad move. While the hard drive and ram are considered &#34;user replaceable&#34; by apple, (they include guides on their website) replacing the hard drive is somewhat of a grey area and from what I was told if you break anything they will void your warranty and apple care. Replacing the optical drive is a huge no-no. I made the mistake of making it obvious that I had. I have a 64gb ssd in the hard drive bay, and moved the hard drive to the optical drive bay (who uses those anyway?). This was after my second visit to the apple store where the sata cable and hard drive had been replaced. This was working fine for almost a year, until roughly a week ago when I started to have the same issue I had before I went to the apple store, a grey screen with a circle and a x through it, indicating no boot drive. Turns out, the connection keeps cutting out. Go to the apple store, and it just works fine that day. That very night, I have the problem again. Take it to the apple store next day, stock and ready to go and I am informed that because I removed &#34;non-user-replacable&#34; parts, my $200 apple care was void. He then proceeded to tell me they couldn't even replace the data cable if we paid for it out of pocket, and that anything that would happen in the future I would have to pay for.$1400 on a laptop and they can't even support they crap they manufacture? I understand I replaced things I shouldn't have, but is all the crap really necessary? I returned it to stock and the issue wasn't even with the optical drive, but the hard drive. This is like buying a computer and a monitor and because you made an upgrade to the computer, the company saying they can't service the monitor. Complete crap. The fact that a company like this is riding on their reputation to carry them through everything and have to sue samsung to keep from going under is sad. The customer service for him to have the audacity to say it to my face that because I chose to upgrade something I own, they can no longer service it even if I pay for it has pushed me over the edge and I have listed every apple product I own on craigslist. Will be officially switching to PC, and never be buying from or recommending Apple to anyone again. No one should have to put up with this after spending that much money on a computer. They know they are a big company and that they don't have to care for anyone, just sell a cardboard box for several thousand dollars and refuse a refund. I can't believe after 10 years of mac use I'm saying this, but I really can't wait until the day Apple goes under. I hope Tim Cook drives it right into the ground."

This is the third in a series of MacBooks starting with a Black MacBook. I decided to go with the faster i7 version and I don't regret it. Everything is faster. I ran Snow Leopard up until buying this MacBook Pro. The only downside was having to give up some older apps that don't run in Mountain Lion. But, I found newer versions or replacements made for the OS that are generally better.Externally, it is the same as my previous Aluminum MBP. Which is great because of the classic design. The design is simple and elegant. If you are a PC user, you might miss the lack of myriads of flashing lights and extra buttons. Besides being elegant, the MacBooks are durable. The previous iterations are all in the hands of family members and still going strong. If you don't have family members to hand down to, the market for used MacBooks is strong and can be sold to help cover the cost of future upgrades.If you are tethered to Windows, there are several options for installing Windows on your new MacBook Pro. So, you can have the best of both worlds in one computer. Yes, the MBP is more expensive than competing PC laptops.

I wanted the familiar Windows OS with the hardware the MBP had to offer, but initially ran into a few problems. I'll post the problems and their solutions that I discovered in case anyone else runs into similar problems.1. After installing the drivers for Windows, my webcam didn't work. It said that the drivers were not installed yet even after I downloaded the most recent driver package from Apple.Solution: it turned out to be pretty simple. My previous laptop had software preinstalled that controlled the webcam and added effects to it, and I erroneously thought that since my MBP didnt have this program that the webcam wasn't working. After installing the drivers my webcam actually worked fine with Facebook chat.2. The MBP got REALLY hot when running windows 7. This couldnt be good for the computer components, but also posed a fire risk.Solution: while on windows I installed a program called MacFan (just google it) that after typing in a few commands in the command prompt allowed me to turn up the fan speed indefinitely to significantly cool off the laptop. While in windows the fans aren't correctly utilized according to CPU usage so you'll have to do this process upon each startup. Just search on YouTube 'how to install macfan' for thorough instructions.3. Videos on youtube while in windows do not expand fully to the screen, instead leaving black bars on the bottom and right sides.Still haven't solved this. I'd expect adjusting the screen resolution would have an effect but I haven't tried this yet.4. The battery life decreased from 7 hours to about 2.5 hours while on Windows.This couldn't be solved either. It's just how windows works on the Mac. The only solution is to turn the brightness down, etc.5. When I click an icon on the taskbar, its title flashes over it. (not the biggest deal but its annoying)Updated my Nvidia drivers from their website and it solved minor graphics problems.As for my actual review of the MacBook Pro, I am very satisfied. I run both windows 7 and mountain lion on it through bootcamp (helpful detailed instructions can be found on YouTube). That way I have the ability to run all my old games and programs on windows while having the Mac side to use for top notch picture and video editing, plus the App Store. I've always preferred the relative simplicity of Microsoft office 2007 for windows, so I use that.After adjusting trackpad and click settings on the windows side, navigation is easy and fluid. The separated keyboard buttons took some adjusting to but that's not any issue. The screen is bright, clear, and rich while the backlit keyboard helps for typing in dark environments.It's about 2 pounds lighter than my previous laptop and significantly thinner, and what I'd consider to be portable. Ill be using it at college next year and will report back on just how portable it is.Graphics, processing, and RAM are all lightning fast and should be useful in intensive software that ill be using. The only problem I've noticed is that after partitioning the hard drive, startup takes a little longer (around 22 seconds total).The power cord is portable and extendable, while its nice to still have the optical drive, Ethernet port, and card slot. Only having 2 USB ports so close in proximity is a minor issue with larger thumb drives, etc. but I may just purchase a separate hub.All in all, you won't regret buying this. The higher cost will pay off well in a long computer life. Thanks for reading and feel free to ask any questions."

I quickly adapted to the changes in the OS, and adore the different finger swipes to move from webpage to webpage and desktop to desktop. The screen gives a clear, crisp picture. It downloads and streams quickly. Honestly, things that took me an hour to do on my old Mac now take half or even 1/3 the time. As someone who needs to occasionally write in a Slavic language, I also appreciate the ease of instantly typing those letterforms with a few keystrokes instead of looking them up on an &#34;obscure glyph&#34; chart.Nitpicks include a caps lock button that doesn't always react to gentle touches and the occasional glare on the glass screen (which I'm sure will not be as much of a problem once I move into an apartment that isn't illuminated exclusively by skylights).But, I couldn't be happier."

Apple in it's infinite wisdom, and in it's greed to apparently want you to download content from its store rather than allowing you to stream Netflix, has removed that port and replaced it with a 'Thunderbolt' port that connects ONLY to its monitor.I'd give Mac up if I was willing to run all kinds of virus protection crapola on a much less expensive Windows machine.  And learn THAT darned OS all over again.BTW, I'm a bit tired of Apple 'naming' its OS versions after animals.

I turned to Linux distributions.  Ubuntu, Mint, and many others offer a great variety of OS to fit my needs.  After years of doing that, I tried my first Mac.  So, here's an aging geek's take on the Mac.Getting accustomed:The first time you start a Mac it take a few minutes to understand the gestures.  What makes all the screens visible, shifts from one workspace to another, and scrolling a page.  Within a few hours I was using the gestures unconsciously.  I found my experience was not atypical when a friend bought her first Mac and was able to make the gestures a habit within a day of on and off use.Browsing files and starting programs is a little different that windows, but it's easy to figure out.  To browse local files, use the Finder and to find a program, use the Launchpad.Compared to Windows 8, figuring out how to use a Mac is a walk in the park.  I have a Win8 machine gathering dust because of this laptop.Hardware:I built many computers.  Most of then are 4+ cores and built for speed.  Apple hardware is not the newest, but it's rock solid.  They make products that work!  Everything is fluid and intuitive- something that can't be said about Win8.Software:Like it's hardware, these Macbooks have well tuned software that simply works.  For those who need to use a Windows program, a program called Parallels works very well to run those programs on a Mac.Price:Yes, you pay a premium for this kind of hardware and software.  Is it worth it?  If you are looking for a long term, everyday laptop- the Macbook is an ideal choice.  If you need something that will get trashed (going on deployment, you tend to drop your laptop, ect) or you just need something short term, maybe an investment in a laptop isn't best.  For some people, a tablet is a better choice.  Samsung makes the Note 10.1 and 8 which read handwriting very well.  Choose hardware that will fit your life.Overall:Great product for home and/or business users that need a full laptop.  Instead of buying a low cost laptop every 2-3 years, get a Mac which will last you 10 years.Note:Please take care of your battery, no matter what laptop/tablet you have.  Try to fully discharge a battery before recharging it.  When recharging it, recharge it fully.  Please, please, don't leave a laptop plugged into the wall all day- you are killing the battery.  Charge, drain, repeat."

I bought this Mac in order to replace my old Dell laptop. I primarily use the computer for school, but it can easily handle extensive tasks (video editing, photoshop etc.) as well. The battery life is good usually averaging between 6-7 hours. I was surprised to discover that this machine can do gaming also, it runs League of Legends and Team Fortress 2 at 60 FPS on the native 1280x800 resolution. OS X is really great at letting you multi-task with ease. I would recommend increasing the ram in order to increase performance on your machine. I installed a 16GB ram kit from Crucial and I noticed an immediate increase in performance. The backlit keyboard is amazing to type on. I have typed for hours and have yet to feel fatigued. The MacBook Pro is a great product which can meet the needs of the average consumer. For those wondering whether to get the MacBook Air or the Pro I would recommend buying the Pro. The MacBook Pro (non-retina) is easily customizable, just buy a SSD and ram and you will have a blazing fast machine in your hands. I hope this review helps."

This model comes with 4GB memory, easily upgradable for minimal cost (I've read confirmed reviews of people successfully putting 16GB of memory in this laptop on newegg.com).

After learning from many who use macs, and the software that's offered, I caught a real bad case of the Joneses and purchased one of these bad boys that I had never gave much thought to in the past. I was so convinced I would love it, I bought 8 gigs of Crucial ram and a geeky toolkit to install it with (which worked very well). Sadly, I just don't get it. Well, I kind of do, but I did not fall in love with it like planned.PROS:1. Everything, and I mean, everything, looks beautiful. Not just the aesthetics, but every single piece of software looks great. OS X designers are light years ahead of Windows, I am 100% convinced of that.2. The App store is amazing, and full of useful software to help with any task you need to perform, especially with Design. This is the #1 reason I wanted to switch to Mac, because of all the wonderful apps that are available that function AND look amazing.3. The trackpad is bananas. I never used my laptops mousepad, because it sucked. The Mac's mousepad is genius.4. The power cord confused the heck out of me at first, but once I figured it out I was very impressed. And the way it connects by a magnet is the coolest thing I have seen in a long time on a computer.5. Expose, Spaces, and Hot corners are genius. Whoever is responsible for those deserves to retire young and be set for life.Cons:I can safely say that most of these cons are opinion and preference based. So please don't take offense if you don't agree.1. Price. I am not fully convinced the high cost is worth it.2. Performance. The performance was fine, but it didn't blow me away like some people who I talked to tried to convince me it would :) Boot up was pretty slow, a lot slower than my 3 year old Vaio running Windows 8. In fact, they pretty much run at the same speeds. But the Mac is a little faster than my Vaio when it is running Windows 7.3. Display. The glossy screen ruined it for me. As I mentioned, I do design work, so any time I try and make something with a Dark background, the screen literally turns into a mirror. I couldn't believe it, and would not recommend a glossy screen to anyone who is going to be working on dark backgrounds, or under any kind of bright lighting. Even in lower lighting, I could still see myself more than I wanted to.4. Only 2 usb ports...seems kind of...limited.5. The dock and global menu are horrible compared to the rest of the features of OS X.Unfortunately, I am returning this. I do give it 4 stars though because it truly is a great computer, but at the same time, currently, not the computer for me. One of these days I will try again, when I have more money to blow adding a Matte screen with more time to spend learning OS X. I think an iMac looks like a lot of fun."

Not only was it referbrished/used, but I was paying so much more than a brand new apple macbook pro would of cost. Got ripped off too. Yeah. I should've looked into that more, but I was right out of high school, so I didn't know much. And let's just say my old macbook pro is hunk piece of junk. Everything that went wrong with it did which I won't get too much into, but I wanted a replacement. PC laptops, I wasn't too crazy about, so I decided to go with an updated version of the Macbook Pro.I had to decide between the this and the Retina Display. I wanted the Retina Display one so bad. I think I wanted it mainly because it is thinner than the regular macbook pro, but did I really want to pay $400 more just for that. It did have other features, yes, but I won't pay $1400 for a laptop. I would do a $1000 for a brand new one though. Getting it in the mail is like Christmas! ALl packaged up securely and when I opened it, it was perfect.I had a 4-5 year old macbook pro. So there were some pretty big changes that I am still getting use to. The trackpad is a little confusing, it scrolls in opposite directions and you can click anyway in there. I think that's the biggest thing I have to use to. It is smaller in size, like weight like, I'm talking about. Love the black keyboard with the lighting. Finally I have photo booth again! I missed it. I am still basically messing around with it, but I remain in love with it.I have had my ups and downs with Apple products in the past, but honestly apple remains to be the best in my opinion. Everything is just so beautiful about their products. Since this one is brand new, I'm going to take care of it like it's my baby."

Looked at HP, ASUS, Acer, Sony and a bunch of other ones but could not find I really liked. This MacBook Pro might is pricey but  I wanted to go with a laptop that had great reviews and this was it.Being a Windows user for 10+ years I wasn't sure if I was going to like the Mac operating system. But once I started using it I got the hang of it in less than a day. OS is built really well and easy to use.I installed 8gigs of RAM on it myself (was super easy) and it can handle tons of windows/tabs open, and shows no signs of being slowed down, for when I write my research papers. I am sure it could do just as well with the basic 4gigs of RAM it comes with but for around $50, 8gigs of RAM is a cheap upgrade. Really fast laptop.Laptop looks and feels great. Keyboard responds well to presses. Track pad is amazing. Responds great to touch. Other track pads I have used have been finicky. AMAZING battery life.

I wanted the familiar  Windows OS with the hardware the MBP had to offer, but initially ran into a few problems. I'll post the problems and their solutions that I discovered in case anyone else runs into similar problems.1. After installing the drivers for Windows, my webcam didn't work. It said that the drivers were not installed yet even after I downloaded the most recent driver package from Apple. Solution: it turned out to be pretty simple. My previous laptop had software preinstalled that controlled the webcam and added effects to it, and I erroneously thought that since my MBP didnt have this program that the webcam wasn't working. After installing the drivers my webcam actually worked fine with Facebook chat.2. The MBP got REALLY hot when running windows 7. This couldnt be good for the computer components, but also posed a fire risk.Solution: while on windows I installed a program called MacFan (just google it) that after typing in a few commands in the command prompt allowed me to turn up the fan speed indefinitely to significantly cool off the laptop. While in windows the fans aren't correctly utilized according to CPU usage so you'll have to do this process upon each startup. Just search on YouTube 'how to install macfan' for thorough instructions.3. Videos on youtube while in windows do not expand fully to the screen, instead leaving black bars on the bottom and right sides. Still haven't solved this. I'd expect adjusting the screen resolution would have an effect but I haven't tried this yet.4. The battery life decreased from 7 hours to about 2.5 hours while on Windows.This couldn't be solved either. It's just how windows works on the Mac. The only solution is to turn the brightness down, etc.5. When I click an icon on the taskbar, its title flashes over it. (not the biggest deal but its annoying) Updated my Nvidia drivers from their website and it solved minor graphics problems.As for my actual review of the MacBook Pro, I am very satisfied. I run both windows 7 and mountain lion on it through bootcamp (helpful detailed instructions can be found on YouTube). That way I have the ability to run all my old games and programs on windows while having the Mac side to use for top notch picture and video editing, plus the App Store. I've always preferred the relative simplicity of Microsoft office 2007 for windows, so I use that.After adjusting trackpad and click settings on the windows side, navigation is easy and fluid. The separated keyboard buttons took some adjusting to but that's not any issue. The screen is bright, clear, and rich while the backlit keyboard helps for typing in dark environments.It's about 2 pounds lighter than my previous laptop and significantly thinner, and what I'd consider to be portable. Ill be using it at college next year and will report back on just how portable it is.Graphics, processing, and RAM are all lightning fast and should be useful in intensive software that ill be using. The only problem I've noticed is that after partitioning the hard drive, startup takes a little longer (around 22 seconds total).The power cord is portable and extendable, while its nice to still have the optical drive, Ethernet port, and card slot. Only having 2 USB ports so close in proximity is a minor issue with larger thumb drives, etc. but I may just purchase a separate hub.All in all, you won't regret buying this. The higher cost will pay off well in a long computer life. Thanks for reading and feel free to ask any questions."

This version of MacBook Pro runs on a third-generation CPU ('Ivy Bridge'), not the latest fourth-generation Haswell CPU the 2013 version has.  That means it has less battery life.  It also lacks a 'Retina' display.  This is the 2012 model that you can buy at the Apple store for exactly the same price.  Not that it a bad laptop - not at all - but it is definitely not the 'newest version' as the ad claims.  Naturally, the actual newest model, similarly equipped, costs more, but it is also in many ways a superior machine (the 500 gig HD is solid state for example).  That is no doubt why one reviewer says he recently bought both a MacBook Pro and MacBook Air and found the latter clearly superior.  The MacBook air with the Haswell CPU (which is what he evidently bought) has been available for far longer than the MacBook Pro with Haswell (introduced only about 1 month ago).

Apple makes a fine product but, I have had very bad luck with them, and they are simply over priced.  For me, If this computer ran fast, stable and efficiently, it would have been worth the cost.  However, this has not been my experience so I am returning this product.I first purchased my macbook off of amazon and it ran glitchy out of the box.  The trackpad was erratic and unstable and programs crashed out of the box.  I contacted apple who gave me the typical line 'well, you have to buy it directly from us to be sure it is good'.  So I sent back my macbook and went through all the trouble of getting a return.  I purchased a new macbook at the inflated apple cost and got my second computer.  I soon realized that I was having more problems that were related to the operating system.  For one thing, I bought this computer to edit movies.  iMovie was a laughably bad program which was non-intuitive and hard to learn.  I shelled out the money to buy Adobe Premier which is an awesome program that I was able to figure out without seeking help.  Unfortunately, this particular program runs very glitchy on a mac.... but wait, I thought these computers were supposed to run these type of programs better than a PC.On top of that there is a massive learning curve when you are switching over from a PC to a Mac.  I don't care was Apple says, Macs are NOT more intuitive then PC's... especially when organizing files.  I ended up spending hours on the phone with apple care to learn how to perform system functions that should be intuitive enough to figure out on my own.  Now, don't get me wrong... this is NOT apple's fault.  Macs are different from PC's and they take time to learn.  However, what IS apple's fault is that they only give you a 14day return window when you order a 1500+ product from them.  This is insulting and unacceptable and is the main reason why I am sending back my second Macbook.  If I was given a more appropriate return window, I likely would have stuck with it but apple is twisting my arm to return it while I can still get my money back.So in the end, here is my final point.  Apple makes a fine product.  However, it has been my experience that shelling out the big bucks for this product DOES NOT GUARANTEE that you are going to escape the headaches of dealing with a PC.  My experience was that I had spent three times as much for buy a product that included the same headaches as a PC if not more.  Keep this in mind when you are purchasing one.  In the end, I think it is better to buy this product from amazon because they actually have a BETTER return policy than Apple themselves."

Then, after an Apple Store update, the system started panicking during a normal 'Shutdown.'  I submitted all 'reports' the MacBook Pro asked I booted back up for about a week.Then, after yet another panic during shutdown the MacBook Pro was rebooted, the user and passwords prompt would no longer recognize ASCII keyboard characters, i.e. a-Z, A-Z, 0-9, etc.  It would, however, allow me to enter Ctr-A through Ctrl-Z, and Alt-A through Alt-Z, just not A-Z and numeric keyboard keys are not be recognized.  I opened a Apple Support ticket, but they are clueless, with two representatives provided divergent  advise.I don't know if I just got a lemming, or if this is a know BUG in Apple OSX.  The only good comments I can say about Apple Support is that they immediately take inbound calls and keep to their call back schedules.  The bad news, they seem unable to correct any but the most simplest, generic issues like a novice computer user's question as to 'where the any key' is located.  (I am a thirty year plus hardware, network and software engineer.)*UPDATE*05-19-2013: After spending my entire Saturday either talking with a CS rep or downloading an update from Apple I can report that Apple technical support was able to fix my issue.

This isn't light years ahead of its competitors however with regard to performance. I was naturally pushing the limits of my beat up Vaio with 30 open tabs on my FireFox browser, but I don't expect to see that rainbow timer icon pop up at all on the new MacBook, much less when I'm just clicking open a webpage. It also stalls when I unlock the computer from sleep though it starts up immediately after I open the clamshell function.It's a great machine and it has so far handled the Adobe Creative Suite projects I've done and the brilliant web development that I've written, but the MacBook has not lived up to its title as the best in the business or its price tag.What, Steve Jobs kicks the bucket and Apple starts falling apart?

I come from the high-end Windows laptop user base; my previous laptop was a Dell XPS. I thought the transition would be difficult at best and would take some time to fully familiarize myself with the new Mac ecosystem. If you are considering switching from a Windows computer, do it. I have no regrets. OS X is simply amazing, and while there is a learning curve if you're coming from another OS, it's easy as pie to understand. Everything just works on a Mac. WIth the exception of some games- but with Boot Camp you can install Windows on any Mac. And this MacBook looks as good as it performs. Simple details, crafted aluminium and real glass make this laptop blow away the other plastic ridden, bulky sticker filled laptops. This computer exceeds my expectations in almost every category.My only issues with the laptop are as follows:1) It looks beautiful. Yes, that's a good thing, but it's made from aluminum that scratches easily. You're better off buying a case alongside the purchase of your mac. A keyboard cover also wouldn't hurt. A scratch on a $1,500 MacBook is unforgivable.2) There is no HDMI port. This is an issue for me, as I frequently connect my computer to my television. But there is a simple solution; purchase a mini-displayport to HDMI adapter.3) The sound on this laptop is severely lacking. On my previous XPS (and other mid-range laptops) sound really wasn't an issue. But with this laptop, the bass is very weak and the sound comes out sounding tinny. My solution to this was to purchase Boom by Global Delight ([...]). Boom is a software application that adds sort of system wide equalizer to the Mac, thus affecting all outgoing sounds. It's a good fix, in my opinion. I have it set up to bass boost all the time, and the music comes out sounding decent, if not SLIGHTLY tinny (MUCH less tinny than before).So there you have it. And if price is a concern, you're really paying for build quality. I've never seen any other laptop at this quality for much cheaper."

From 1988 to 2010 I was a graphic arts professional, electronically based on Macintosh computers, and a consultant to other such professionals in helping them deal with computers in their business. But when Apple walked away from supporting older software, some of which CANNOT be updated, by discontinuing Rosetta when they introduced their Lion operating system, I decided I would no longer purchase, support or recommend a Mac.Unfortunately my wife's 2009 MacBook Air developed a hardware problem that didn't seem worth repairing. I couldn't talk her out of another Mac, and very I'm sorry for that. This mac has been a problem since we got it. Even though it uses an I7 Intel processor, it is no faster and may be slower than the system it replaced. Startup times are incredibly long: over two minutes. This has to be because of software bloat from what I would argue is the worst MacOS since the original 128k mac introduced in 1984 (which I owned).Perhaps if you've never owned a computer, none of this would bother you, but if you come from an older mac or from the Windows side, the clunkiness and sloth will drive you nuts. In addition, of course, since pre-intel software is no longer supported, about 1/3 of my wife's programs were trashed. Some we could replace (the Office suite for $150 we didn't need because the version we had served her needs, but won't run on the new mac), while others have never and will never be updated. Fortunately we do have other older macs (Snow Leopard or earlier capable) so we can kludge.Recently however, this Macbook loses the ability to print to our network laser printer, a HP Color Laser Jet. The computer says it can't find the printer, even though it printed to it 10 minutes before, and other computers on the ethernet, both mac and windows, can also print to it. Given the way print spooling works the only reliable way to reestablish printing capability has been to trash the print que and create a new one. Sometimes this is possible through Bonjour (the Apple print protocol) or more likely it must be done via direct ip addressing, which in our local LAN with an address of 192.168.x.x, the computer thinks our printer is in Boise, Idaho! How stupid is that?By the way, when the print que is deleted to fix the printer, everything in that que is lost. Not a problem unless we were printing many pages from different web addresses which were sent to printer while we went on without keeping track. Rebuilding such a que is a pain.If you already have a Lion-based Mac, then getting this computer will not surprise you and you will probably find it very nice because you don't know any better. If you have an older mac, or a windows system, I strongly suggest you go to windows or stay there. You will be sadly disappointed with this."

I bought this MacBook Pro to replace my six-year-old PC (a Sony Vaio), but it was basically no better than my old PC, so I returned it.  Big problems: it took 36 seconds to open Microsoft Word.  Why on earth would a brand new computer take that long?  It dropped the wireless connection incessantly (no, it wasn't the internet's fault, because my iPad and my Vaio both could hold the connection from the exact same place in the house). The computer woke up from sleep pretty quickly, but it took at least 60 seconds to boot.  So, I returned it, and instead I got an Acer Aspire, which I love (it's 2.5lbs, i7, 256GB SSD, and it was $950--to get a MacBook Air like that, it would cost $1700)."

Every day I had this computer, something failed on it. The most-common failure is the computer failed to sync with my other apple products. Every time I attempted to sync the laptop, it would fail the first couple of times.The second most-common problem is that the computer would hang, most of the time while I was doing work on it. Once it even hung while attempting to draw the login box just after power up.The third most-common problem is that the bottom of the laptop would get so hot, that I could not touch it without burning my hands or legs. I am hoping that the laptop does not start a fire in my home when I am away from the laptop and it is transcoding my video files.The fourth most-common problem is that the laptop screen would just go black for 3 to 30 minutes before I am able to power on my system.The Fifth most-common problem with the laptop is that the laptop is not holding a charge. I could have a full charge and unplug it from the adapter and within one hour my battery would be going dead.I initially took my laptop to the Apple Store in South dale Mall sometime in July or August 2012. The tech ran some diagnostics on the laptop and reported to me that the logic board needed to be replaced. My system was held at the store for about two days.In November 2012 I took my laptop back to the Southdall Mall because I was experiencing the same issues and at that time I talked with three different techs for about two hours. The technition reset the SMC and parametric memory. They also re-install the OS X operating system from the delivery DVD. None of the attempted repairs worked.I have taken my laptop to the Apple store in the Lenox Square Mall multiple of times for this issue and they to has failed to resolve my issue and has failed to log that I have brought my laptop in for service. This store representative is rude and I am not happy with the condescending attitude that Apple employees via store and phone has given me.Having paid for a brand new laptop, I am quite unhappy with the sequence of events that left me with a refurbished laptop. I feel that I am owed a substantial compensation. The 'new' laptop that I purchased turned out to be such a lemon. I also feel that I was sold a faulty unit and I have endured frustration for months.I thought I was purchasing a premium laptop, I feel that I have been cheated and not provided with what I paid for. Because of all the trouble that I have encountered since I received this laptop, I could have purchased a PC at a cheaper cost and could have had multiple of systems for the price I paid for this Mac Pro.The Apple Care Product Repair Summary talks about ensuring 'the highest level of quality and reliability.' That is certainly NOT what I have experienced. My confidence in Apple products has been greatly degraded because of this experience. Can you apple still want to attempt to troubleshoot my computer after a year?"

I was finally done with high school and moving on to bigger and better things. All my life I had been striving for the best and getting my first laptop was not going to be anything short of the best. After my graduation party and selling my car, I finally saved enough money to purchase my first `real' life purchase. I knew I wanted a MacBook Pro since early senior year and now was the time that I was finally going to get it! I begged my mom to come with me to Best Buy to help me buy it. She didn't see the need to come with so I brought my sister. Checking and double checking that I had the right amount of money in my checking account I told the sales woman that I'd like to buy a MacBook Pro 13 inch. She gladly went to the back to get it and without hesitation I swiped my debit card. A screen popped up asking if I wanted to purchase insurance. Being the 18-year-old kid with only a new laptop on my mind, I stupidly said no thanks. After signing my life savings away, I walked/ran out of the store carrying my new `baby', just as the store was closing for the night. Getting home I opened the box and started to set-up and install all of the new and coolest things on my computer. At around 12:30 that night, after convincing my mom that Macs never had any problems and they were the best laptops around, my laptop completely shut down. It was charging so I knew the battery was fine, but it still wouldn't turn back on. Reluctantly I walked downstairs with tears forming in my eyes. How would I tell my mom that it wasn't working. After spending what seemed like days on her laptop searching what could be wrong, we decided to call the Apple helpline. They were dumbfounded, just as we were. They said that we must have gotten the `lemon' and that I should not have any problems returning it tomorrow for a new one. It was the longest night of my life. Waking up at the crack of dawn, we exchanged the `lemon' for a new one, as well as bought the highest amount of insurance possible. I've now had it for almost a year and have not had any problems with it. If I had to choose a MacBook over a windows laptop, I would still pick the MacBook hands down even with the small mishap in the beginning. I definitely think that the saying of `good things happen to those who wait,' truly applies to me, if I waited rather than being rash, I would have had no problems with my `baby.'"

My company bought me the Apple Macbook Pro MD101LL/A 13.3-Inch laptop because I have to build some mobile applications with XCode.Coming from Ubuntu, I quickly learned that the Apple developer world is not as well-supported by applications I commonly use such as wine for running Windows software. An application I've been running on Wine in Ubuntu does not run on OSX. There's Virtualbox but not VMWare player. My favorite desktop editor Geany is not available on OSX and a lot of the better text editors are expensive. Running Ubuntu in Virtualbox in OSX is pretty fast so that's what I've been doing to get my real work done. Also, can't get Terminator (probably the best terminal application in existence on OSX). Boo hoo.There is some software that it's nice to finally have a chance to try out like Unity3D and there are more games available on Steam, not that I have a lot of time to play them right now.The laptop case seems pretty sturdy but the keys seem like they're designed to pop off. They feel flimsy and this surprised me. Also, I hate not having a right mouse button click implemented on the touchpad.If you have to use OSX or you're worried about what people will think of you if you don't have an Apple than this is the laptop for you. Otherwise you can get a comparable laptop for 60 - 70% of the price and put Ubuntu on it and have a better offering of free software and a more robust developer environment."

I bought it because i wanted a portable DAW and i had some tax money left over.  Coming from windows was not an easy transition however. Macs are confusing as balls. You download something and it dissapears forever....until you find it. You try to drag a file to your desktop screen and all you've accomplished was creating two of that file. Which is terrible if your moving 34Mb raw audio files. Once i figured out how everything works (about a week) i found that working on a Mac is just waaaaaaay faster and more productive than working on windows. From the DAW perspective, Mac doesn't support VST format...so thats kind of an issue. Your plugins have to be AU format and theres not many of them out there. Sucks. But...this computer comes with iLife or whatever its called. Basically Garageband, and some photo and video editing software (dont care). Garagebands not bad. Its like a super dumbed down version of Logic, which is Mac only anyway, so probably a good place to start. It comes with pretty much everything you'll need to start recording. Got a guitar, and that rocksmith game? well, macbook pro recognizes that cable and you can record directly into your usb port into garageband. pretty cool. No driver install necessary...like on a windows computer, where you would need ASIO4ALL or something. Performance wise, its not the fastest laptop in the world...but theres an i7 core model that probably runs like lightning, and people are putting extra memory in these computers anyway. $100 from crucial.com. Its only crashed on me one time in the 3 months i've had it. it was right in the middle of recording tho, so that sucked. So far, only 1 hiccup, no viruses still got plenty of memory even with buttloads of plugins and software installed. runs smooth. 4 out of 5."

The box was beat all to hell.  Could not believe that it was sent this way, but decided to try it out since there is a 30-day money back guarantee.  Well, the computer did not work properly.  Could not even get it past the set-up stage.  I called Apple Care to try and troubleshoot it with them, and they were totally boggled about it.  I just think it got beat up during the shipping process and was messed up internally.So, I called to complain about it, to get my money back, and explained the way it was shipped and left.  Amazon rep I spoke with seemed surprised, and immediately issued refund to me.  In order to send it back, though, I had to prepare different packaging because it had to be insured (over $1000 item), and UPS would not accept it to send back the very same way it was shipped to me.  It cost $42.00 for UPS to insure and package it properly to send it back to Amazon.  I had to fight with Amazon to get that $42 reimbursed to me.  But they did.So... next chapter.... I ordered another one, thinking surely they would not send it the same way again.  But they sure did.  Except for not leaving it at my door and having me go to UPS office to pick up in person.  But it did not have any separate box/padding for shipping/handling.  Such an expensive piece of equipment should be better protected for shipping.  I did not even take it home the second time... just said return to sender immediately.I ordered a third laptop, of the brand new, not refurbished variety, still waiting to receive it.

The battery lasts as advertised (give or take 15-20 minutes), and the entire user experience is very elegant. I like the little quirks of the latest operating system as well (full screen mode!). I had a Powerbook G4 11.6&#34; before, and that little beast lasted nearly 6 years (one battery change, RAM upgraded later), and the build quality on that computer was awesome. I mean I accidentally dropped it multiple times, had minor spills on the keyboard, and it still went strong. Finally, it was slowing down considerably last year, and the fan noise kept getting louder, so I was looking for a new laptop. I have always been a fan of Apple laptop's build quality, and the friendliness of the operating system. I am a proficient user of Windows as well, but I always find that the hardware manufacturers always let the operating system down. I compared the quality of Sony Vaio 15&#34; S series computer at a local Microsoft Store (with Signature), and though the prices for both the Mac and Sony Vaio were very similar, the overall computing experience was far superior on a Mac.I have used this computer for quite a while now, and this computer works very well. No glitches, no hang-ups - nothing but smoothness. I highly recommend this computer to any new buyer.

With such a machine, any audiophile or media person is practically assured of having a self-contained portable audio workstation, one that will record LPs, cassette tapes, FM broadcasts with a simple line (in my case, from an Onkyo receiver) to the 'Audio In' of the machine, nothing else required.  Moreover, the presence of the two ports permits near-flawless capturing of any of the sounds emitted from a website or from the computer by attaching a simple patch cord between the two ports (I use an inexpensive splitter at the 'Audio Out' port for monitoring purposes.  Finally, the built-in optical drive obviates the need to drag along an external drive, which can prove clumsy at best (taking up extra space on the desk) and mal-functioning at worst (I've never had a problem with an internal SuperDrive, but the external Apple Drives have failed with astonishing regularity, requiring all sorts of ingenious tricks to remove a stuck CD and often suffering damage in the process of removal).By contrast with this machine, the new iMac (and most of the other Macbooks) offers neither an optical drive nor an 'audio in' port. Moreover, with the lack of an internal optical drive, I've forfeited two of the machine's USB ports--one to an interface; the other, to a burner--while attempting, with sporadic success, to import decent audio into the computer.  (At least, I've learned to purchase only external optical drives that have an eject button and a slide-out tray.  None of the non-Apple optical drives has presented so much as a single problem--and each has cost me under $50).I was among the first to purchase the unloved, scorned-upon Macbook Air back in 2008.  The first model had some costly problems (that problematic hinge!), but Apple withstood the flak (especially about the absence of an optical drive) and by 2010 came to market with not one but two Macbook Airs--an 11' and  13'.  The criticism has waned, and now I'd be the first to recommend an Air for truly portable computing.  Unfortunately, what was once regarded as an aberration, then a curiosity, and finally a respected member of the Apple family, has now, it would appear, become the 'prototype' for all Apple models.  I would expect the machine you're looking at to be the last Apple machine to come with the 3 features mentioned above.This may be a transitional time in Apple's history, one leading, moreover, to another consumer computing revolution and to a roaring comeback in Apple's stock price.  If people increasingly find CDs useless--even in their music collections--and if makers of ancillary products begin to show more products that might benefit from the added speed of US 3.0 and Thunderbolt (which is close to being all that remains of Apple connectivity apart from 'the Cloud'), Apple could win big--really big.  But in the meantime, consumers who purchase, for example, a new iMac can only be left scratching their heads about how to make use of all those super-fast ports (USB 3 and Thunderbolt) on the back of their new machines, however ahead of the curve they may be.  At this point, the iMac has become less about practicality than bragging rights ('look guys, mine has a Fusion Drive--just take my word for it')."

Worst of all my Apple computers, and I own all of them","This is a new post mid-2012 Macbook pro non-retina, purchased it on sale new best buy. Owning everything Apple owns, and having my older macbook side by side, and my new Mac Air beside it as well, and after endless adjustments in brightness and contrast, there is no doubt the screen used on the macbook pro non-retina is inferior to my MacAir and macbook.Apple uses Samsung and LG on their monitors on the same model, both in the Retina MBP and non-retina, but they dont advertise this fact. As of 3/19/2013 Apple is being sued over the 'secret' that MBP retina use either LG or Samsung, but you dont know which one youre getting until you notice bad ghosting on the screen (which is the LG problem, not found on the Samsung). Its sad that you 'roll the dice' on WHO made your monitor on two MBP exact same model and mfg. date. That is something Apple should've known would soon rear its head like a snake in the night.Foremostly I must comment that I own Apple stock, and own tons of their products and sing their praises to no end, as such I am not an 'apple hater' by any stretch. I am shocked at how fuzzy, and flat the screen is on this MBP, and wonder WHO made the monitor on this laptop, since you never know, and Apple isnt saying, and they wont tell you, nor is it indicated on the box WHO made the monitor, since Apple uses multiple suppliers for the SAME MAC models.I am returning this unit for a refund, the screen is rather painful to read and type on, ...and since I use 7 different computers, I am not 'addicted to one type of screen', and am adjusted to many, ...but this unit is painfully unbearable.Side by side, believe it or not, BUT TRUE, the speakers on my Mac Air crank out crisper and MUCH LOUDER at full on same tunes than this MBP does. This isnt subjective or conjecture is rock hard FACT. You would think just the opposite on the larger MBP, but thats a fact.Another minus is the squishy jello-keyboard touch, a really undesirable (generally to most who hate this) feature.Ive read a lot of INSANE comments by others rebuking others saying 'my mac air is better than this MBP'. Well heres two empirical facts, all the upgrades money can buy: SSD, mem, etc, WILL NOT change the 'stink-factor' of the screen on this MBP, or the squishy keyboard, OR the inferior speaker output.Yes, the optical drive is nice (no bluray, shame on apple for po-pooing optical drives), and the ethernet, but the mac air is about as lite as an ipad and does 90% of what this Mac Pro does,...so the math is simple.The only negative against this unit is the same as ALL Apple computers, that being Apple is insanely stingy on memory. There is not any Apple product that doesnt immediately need a Mem upgrade. Given the extremely high price of all Apple laptops etc, the pathetic lack of memory is morbidly sad.Barring the horribly bad screen, and nasty squishy keyboard feedback, the unit is fast and well built, but for its price, etc, the mac air is far far moreso a desirable product. Endless speed tests show negligible difference side by side over many apps and overloading between the two on a year older Mac Air."

All I haft to say is go with this computer and don't regret it because it is awesome."

And at first I was thinking I was going to get something like a i7 with dedicated Gpu windows computer. But I am glad I didn't!FOR ALL WINDOWS FANS, first of all I want to share that I do not hate windows since I game on my windows desktop that I built myself.But my experience with windows laptops has not been the best. Always had miscellaneous problems with video drivers, screen, touch pad you name it! But I thought to myself that hey! at least I have really good spec laptop. Wrong! once I switched to mac all those things seemed unacceptable! I have now noticed that apple really take their time making their laptops and quality is there as well! Now here are some of my reviews of the specs.Cpu- although its a dual core it has more than enough speed for everyday useGpu- although its a integrated gpu it has more than enough everyday power for regular use. (unless your a gamer, or need the dedicated gpu for high demanding work) , which a lot of us do not need for college.Hard drive - this is the one thing I am considering upgrading for the 5400 rpm speed to a 7200 rpm hard drive since it is a cheap but effective upgrade for boot times and opening apps.Ram - this I am not even considering upgrading since this ram is fast and 4GB is more than enough for everyday use. The only reason I would upgrade is if I would be running many apps at the same time.Screen - although some people might complain about low res which I think is ridiculous. I will also say it is much better than I expected! Since the contrast of colors makes it seem so crisp! I would go as far as saying the colors and contrast is better than some pc laptops with higher res screens.Cooling design- I also think this is better since MB's do not has fans under and on the sides where when you have it on your lap it will suck in a considering of dust. The mac-book's cooling system is made in a way where you can actually consider it a LAP top.Other things like DVD-RW drive was my deal breaker to get the non-retina pro since I need it.Also the network plug is a plus since if you do not have reliable wifi it will come in handy!Back-lit keyboard which also was a must and is am glad to say it is very good.Speakers- are the one thing I miss from my windows laptop. Since these are loud enough if there are no loud obstructions near you, but do not let throw you off because they are fine for moderate noises for example: at starbucks.Touchpad- this is the most profound thing that makes any other touchpad inferior and make it feel way ahead of it's time! Makes web browsing a breeze and switching either from windows, to desktop or anything a breeze!This laptop is light enough to carry in your backpack the whole day. Has a nice aluminum finish, but I considered getting a sleeve and case to ensure I would not damage or scratch it.If you need the extra performance I would strongly urge you to get a 15' MBP since they have the added dedicated Gpu, i7 Cpu, and better speakers.If you need a windows operating system for a app then I would urge you to partition your hard drive for both os systems since you will still use mac os much much much more!All in all many people (like me) think they need a high spec laptop for school which is not true! I would strongly urge you to try out a macbook! It made me switch and I am sure you will too!"

The description said that the headphone jack also doubled as an audio input, and that it could be reversed in system preferences. But guess what? ... Not true! To my dismay, I have been unable to use the audio port as an input, despite Apple having advertised it as such. I searched online to figure out what I was doing wrong, and lo and behold, everyone is having the same problem.

It was also suffering from hardware (keyboard) issues, relatively slow performance and shortening battery lifetime.  I chose the MBP over the MacAir because of the extra ports, DVD burner, etc, accepting the extra weight which was not that important to me.  I love the new platform, though it took some getting used to with the Launch Pad and Command Center paradigms.Con:  The only small complaint I have is the power cord attachment to the laptop.  It has a 90 degree bend in it that either requires the cord to bend along (and partially cover) the various ports on the side of the laptop or bend away to the rear which generates a long loop for me the way I plug it it with the possibility of accidentally popping out.Pro:  Besides delivering the higher level performance that I expected of the new platform, the display on the MBP is much better than my old MacBook which had a poor quality display with a waviness I never liked and poor off-angle viewability."

Assisting this person in learning the Apple system I was forcefully reminded about the differences between Windows and OS X. Accessing resources in Windows, by comparison is quite clumsy, and the ready access to OS X resources is so in-your-face that it's confusing to someone who has limited their use of their PC in the past from the lack of ease in finding what they wanted. Although Microsoft and Microsoft-based computers have replicated many of the interface features of the Apple system, the native functions of an Apple computer running Apple software is remarkably more intuitive. This person needs to unlearn many of their Windows habits, just as I did when I moved to Apple.2/23 Addition - After reading a few of the five-star reviews on this product, I feel I should apologize for my wimpy review above. About three years ago, I bought my first Mac, a MacBook Pro 13' and experienced the genuine thrill of using this excellent machine. I assumed most of the reviews would be from confirmed Mac users, but was pleasantly surprised to find that most were like me, converts from Windows. So I want to join the chorus of praise for these excellent machines, dictating this review from my 11' inch MacBook Air, my constant companion. Of course everything I do on my Air is shared with my MacBook Pro 'portable desktop' as well as my iPod Touch, perhaps the most important thing about the Apple system. For you newcomers, welcome home.By the way, I lied. My first Mac was actually a Mac Classic II, the little box that ate the lunch of all the PCs that existed in 1992. My work 'converted' me to Windows laptops until 2009."

I wanted to explore what the Mac was all about. 6+ years later it's still working just fine, but with a limit of 2 gig of RAM, it was getting a bit slow and behind the times.It's nice to see Apple still making a laptop with a DVD/CD drive. The price from Amazon was GREAT, so, I had to order it. The buying experience was good. However my experience with UPS was a 0 on a scale of 0-10. The driver did not knock on my door, left a post it note notice. I went to UPS that night. The driver had checked in and they could not find the box. I was told it would be at Pick Up the next day. I went back the next day, they could not locate it, and discovered that it was on the truck. I missed the driver by 3 minutes. He did leave it with a neighbor, and if I had not found the driver who was exiting the apartment complex, i would have had no idea where he left it. Bad UPS, BAD.Anywho, back to the MacBook Pro. While the screen is not Retina, it is still superb. Far superior to my MacBook. The build quality is typical Apple, solid, solid, solid. The SuperDrive is quiet. Sound quality is very acceptable.I haven't had it long enough to test battery life, but I will assume that up to 7 hours is realistic.The Intel i7 processor and 8 gig of RAM makes this a great desktop replacement.Based on my time with the Black MacBook I decided to take out Apple Care. It did come in hand once way back when and more than paid for itself the first and only time I used it. By the way, the Black MacBook is still running strong. All I needed to do for it was replace the battery in February 2013 as it had swelled.The MacBook Pro may look pricy at first, but due to the build quality, parts used and it having an aluminum body, I can see this one lasting 7 years or more. In that light, the 13.3' MacBook Pro is very reasonable in price and a winner in performance. And with Parallels 8 I am also using Windows 98SE, XP and 7 on my MacBook Pro. All run as if they were on a native Windows desktop machine. The 8 gig of RAM and the i7 processor make running virtual software a snap. With the latest MacBook Pro I actually have 4 computers in one. The latest version of OS X, and three versions of Windows. Combined with the SuperDive, great battery life, a crisp display and solid build quality, I am a very pleased user."

I called Apple support, and after working with a Tier One advisor who was not very informed, I was escalated to a Tier Two advisor.This is my second experience in 20 years with Tier Two Apple support. The first in the 90s, the second in 2013. Both experiences are the best tech support I have ever experienced, by far. In this example, my router's firmware was old and needed updating. The advisor tried several things, then had me look at the router. He helped me update my router's firmware, even though my router is not an Apple product! Because that's what it would take to resolve my problem.I am not experiencing internet problems anymore. Apple has successfully turned a situation around from regretfully wanting to return my computer to being completely satisfied.I give 4 stars instead of 5 because of my experiences at the Apple Store and with the Tier One advisor. If they had taken me seriously, I would have been able to resolve the problem sooner.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I really want to give a good review. I had a mac in the 90s, back when only graphic artists and schools had them. It lasted for years, easy to upgrade.I cheaped out after that and bought several PC laptops, none of which lasted over 4 years. So, I decided to spend the dough and go back to a mac.I cannot maintain a wireless connection. Sometimes, it goes out every 3 minutes. Sometimes, if I'm lucky, I get as much as 20. Doing the research I, admittedly, should have done before purchase, I find that thousands of people are having the same problem.I have purchased a cheap wireless adapter, rather than do what the Apple store advised, which was to buy a new router (none of the other computers in my household have any problems). Hopefully, bypassing the mac's wireless capabilities will do the trick.But, that is pretty pathetic for an $1,100 machine, right? Plus, Apple seems to be in denial over the issue. They should at least be honest with their customers. Their own support forums are overflowing with people reporting this problem:[...][...][...][...][...][...]Like I said, I am far from a mac hater. I was really excited to receive this laptop, and I wish I could give it a good review. But wireless connectivity is mission critical. Sorry, Apple, this is a fail. I had to restart my wifi 2 times during the course of writing this review."

I previously owned an older Dell laptop that died after about 5 or 6 years. I was skeptical at first. I thought the price was outrageous, still do, but I am glad I invested in it. I considered another Windows computer, I particularly like Windows 8 and I saw a lot of decent options from HP well under the Mac pricepoint. I visited a few stores to try them both out. But I decided since I have an iphone and ipad, it would be easier to link everything together if I got the Mac, so I did. You won't regret it! Its an awesome beautiful computer. It does everything I need, its fast, and its user friendly. If I ever run into a problem, I generally find my answer in the Apple support forums. They're extremely helpful. As far as insurance its costly, I wouldn't go with anyone besides Applecare or Best Buy's geek squad. Other cheaper options available on other sites are not trustworthy to me, plus they make you ship your computer out of the country and you are usually left without for weeks. No thank you. Bottom line, if you can afford it, get a Mac! If not, HPs are an awesome option as well, but consider lifespan and what type of user you are. Do your research!UPDATE:Still enjoying my Macbook Pro...considered trading for a newer model Macbook Air or Macbook pro w/retina. But after spending hours in the stores testing them out and reading reviews, I realized that although this model is older, it performs just as well as the newer models. The newer models are faster with downloading, but not a huge difference. I realized I would have to sacrifice features available on this model for thinness and faster downloading. Not worth the extra money I would have to spend and I'm comfortable knowing I could upgrade my 4GB ram to 8GB and my i5 to i7 whenever I want, if need be.  For me, this model works very very well and is not as heavy as it seems being compared to the Air or Macbook Pro Retina. She's a keeper!"

This is where I would do all of my homework, but because of my other family members this became more and more strenuous. My mac laptop fixed this issue.  This laptop is a fine device, it is very sleek and modern. I actually enjoy using this laptop whenever I open it. The screen resolution is crisp and clear.  The 13 inch width of the screen works great for me. The screen doesn't feel to big but at the same time It still doesn't feel too small.  I have never used a mac before, and I was scared that my steep learning curve would be a major issue. But i was pleasantly surprised to find out that I was wrong. Much of the user interface on the mac is pretty intuitive. Also when their is something that a user does not know but needs to find out, google is a quick and easy way to find this knowledge.  Mac's also seem to be quite durable! i have dropped mine a couple times with only a slim plastic case covering it. Yet my mac continues to function properly. Also I have spilled water on it once or twice and my mac still continues to work perfectly.  I would recommend buying this mac to anyone who is looking for a sleek and trendy personal computer, that is also functional and durableThe cost is a bit high but worth it in my opinion.

Then the system would many times not power down without a forced power-off. The problems only got worse: reformatted the system hard drive to try and fix the system and then it lost total ability to connect to the Internet.Thank goodness that I bought Applecare before the included warranty expired. So I brought it into the local Apple Store for repair. This was a mistake.After 14 days, and two separate trips, and even a phone call to support in between the first and second repair, I'm still not sure that they got it right. First they replaced the logic board and the second time the memory. In the last 4 days after the second repair the system froze with a tick-tick-tick sound until forced powered off.There was a large 4-day gap in the second repair when, after two unanswered calls to the store, the Store employee who finally answered my return call to them (which stated that they needed a call with my go-ahead) did not inform the original Apple store employee that I had authorized the go ahead, so the system sat not being repaired for 4 days until they called me again asking for the same authorization.Now I am wondering if the hard drive is bad and caused the OS corruption and not the RAM. I bet they didn't check this.I now believe that I cannot trust this system, nor the repair techs at the Apple Store that I took it into.I now want a replacement system, refurbished or new, since I've lost trust in this system now and have spent countless hours restoring from my backups. If this had been a work system, I would have been down for 14+ days.I loved my older MacBook Book Pro 15' and it only needed a new logic board after 3+ years. This one was to be my dream replacement system and I am in no way confident that this will last 1/2 as long.Needless to day, I am really very disappointed in Apple. Poor customer service has really wrecked this experience for me. The only reason I am giving it above a 1 star is that when it works, the system is pretty awesome: fast, beautiful screen and physically perfectly sized.UPDATE 2/4/13: More problems surfaced since my last review. Video is now officially glitchy (white/random rectangles dancing across the screen before the screen goes black) and has joined a new problem: a 3-Beep (pause) 3-Beep (pause) repetition that occurs when coming out of sleep mode. This beep will not stop until the system is hard-powered down. Apparently, this has to do with a memory issue--like the RAM that they replaced at the Apple Store.I now have an escalation going with an Apple Care Senior Adviser, apparently higher than your standard Apple Care tech, who promised to fix this given the myriad of problems. At this rate, they will probably replace everything within the unibody shell before they simply give me even a refurbished replacement system.Update 2/28/13: after now weeks of remote analysis and reporting, and essentially nothing being fixed, I've now been authorized to mail in the system for repair (with promises that Apple will not let me be stuck with a non-working system). At this point, it is so unstable that I cannot even do a backup without the screen shuddering and then the system locking up completely. I'm resigned that the hard drive will need full replacement as well as the RAM, and that I will essentially need to rebuild the system (again) from the backups. I'm hearing 4-5 business days and NO promises of a new/rebuilt system at all. More when I get it back."

But was this achieved solely through 'cutting-edge' technology and innovations in computer science? Not really. And the reason why is because they've created for themselves an air of smug and elitist attitudes for its consumers, achieved through their exorbitant and overpriced laptop specifications, hostile ad-campaigns('I'm a Mac. And I'm a PC' advertisements come to mind), and supposed revolutions in technology ('Retina Display' was one such feature they've touted as revolutionary, a feature advertised as bringing high-resolution display. However, despite that, it was IBM who had actually invented the idea of a 'Retina Display', as early as 1998). Simply put, they've cultivated for themselves the pinnacle of consumerist attitude.By buying into their appeal (both literally and figuratively), you've now become part of an 'in-group' of like-minded people who believe they possess cutting-edge technology. But the product specifications are hardly cutting-edge, and neither is its value. See, what Apple is infamous for that many of its consumers are unaware of, is that their specifications of a typical Macbooks are usually weaker in comparison to their PC counterparts. For example, I'll compare the basics specs of the current top-of-the-line Macbook, the MacBook Pro 13.3-Inch, to the basic specs of a generic PC desktop that I've found on NewEgg(a website dealing in the market of computer goods), the Avatar AMD FX-Series(link included at bottom).'Priced at $589, the PC Desktop Avatar AMD FX-Series features 8GigaBytes of RAM, 3.3GHz processor, 1Terabyte hard-drive space and an AMD Radeon HD 7770 graphics card.Priced at $1,049, the MacBook Pro 13.3-Inch boasts 4GigaBytes of RAM, 2.5GHz processor, 500GB's of Hard-drive space and an Intel HD Graphics 4000 graphics card.'For almost twice the cost of the PC Desktop, you get almost half the power. And this is being generous with the generic desktop, as buying pre-built desktops are actually significantly more expensive than assembling it yourself. Upgrading the internal hardware of a desktop PC literally involves replacing whatever part you wanted to replace (for example, going in and replacing its hard-drive or replacing an old RAM stick). The cost? Whatever it cost you to buy that new part. The cost of 'upgrading' a Macbook? However much it costs for an entirely new Macbook, as Apple doesn't allow for the manual replacement of their hardware.Another unfortunate reason to not invest in Apple's products are its awful working conditions set forth for its workers in their manufacturing plants. Foxconn, a major multinational electronics manufacturing company, is one such company contracted by Apple to produce their gadgets. Foxconn has come under controversy for overworking their staff and cutting their wages. It's gotten to the point where workers have to sign a document that states they will not make any attempt to commit suicide (and several workers have made this attempt before. Pictures taken of the exterior of Foxconn buildings show that there is literally a thick webbing of rope outside every possible escape, designed so that it catches workers). While Apple has made attempts to oversee this issue (they've hired the Fair Labors Association to try and improve working conditions for Foxconn), they seem to not do a very good job at handling things ahead of time: Pegatron, another manufacturing company, has been contracted to manufacture Apple products. But unfortunately for Apple, Pegatron has recently come under fire for its use of child labor in their manufacturing plants.And the final insult? The viruses. Macs were once touted as never needing to have antivirus software, because of its supposed immunity to all sorts of infections. Apple had no problem advertising this as yet another innovation of the standard Macintosh product, and it worked: The notion that your own computer would never be compromised by a malicious Trojan or key-logger was a huge selling point to many computer-illiterate people. But in reality? Viruses were able to infect Mac products as much as their PC counterparts. The only reason they didn't at first were two key things: 1) Mac's are closed-source, meaning, their source code isn't widely available, which meant that it makes it difficult to make programs for Macs (in particular, viruses).2) Initially small market share. Because it was once a relatively unpopular product, there weren't many of them manufactured, which meant that not many people had them, which meant that there wasn't an overall interest to create viruses for Macs, as viruses are normally created usually for the purpose of stealing information. Because the software was new (and closed-sourced), and because not many important businesses and/or people initially used them, there was little to no interest to create viruses for Macs. But now, as the number of people who own Mac products grow, so too does the interest of creating Trojans, key-loggers and other malicious programs.When the first reports of Mac viruses started cropping up(one such infamous virus, the 'MacDefender' virus), some unfortunate consumers were initially confused about why their mac product had been acting up. Some of these same consumers would end up calling tech support on how to fix their product. Apple's response? Deny the existence of viruses. They had been so caught up in their 'all-powerful-Mac' hubris, that instead of owning up to what they had promised, they chose to not assist the same people who had put money into their products.Fortunately, all that said, the typical Mac product isn't without its upsides: With an ingenious laptop cord design(forcefully ejecting the cord from the laptop causes little risk of internal damage, as the end of the cord is a small magnetic strip), and with newer products becoming paper thin and lightweight, it's not completely terrible. However, these do not completely make up for any of the faults it has.Thus, that is why I'm choosing to 'think different' and stay with PC. Not only do I get more out of my money with it, I also have more variety in what I'm able to do with my PC, as the only real blunders I have to deal with is Windows 8. And even then, Windows 8 is an optional upgrade.  Overall, I give the above Macbook Pro laptop, 2 stars out of 5."

"459","XX","B0074703CM","4.0","9","11","February 4, 2013","A346V0H52GTB14","The Computer for the few of us","For a premium laptop sold in 2013, the Apple MacBook Pro (13 inch, base model) is about as basic as it gets: no SSD, no discrete graphics, no 1080p display, and no touch screen. But Apple does not pretend it has any of these. What it does have is great reliability on the software side and hardware side, Apple's OSX Mountain Lion, the sleek looks Apple always delivers, reasonable specs, good battery life, nice keyboard, and excellent trackpad.Now, the question is, who is this computer for? Those looking for a bargain laptop will shy away from the enormous price tag, and those who want to play the latest games do not ever use Macs. The average computer user will be served better by a Macbook Air, since it is faster (for basic tasks), lighter, and has a higher-res antiglare screen. The MacBook Pro 13.3 inch laptop is for those who want to use a Mac, but value performance and upgradability over weight and screen resolution. This Mac will last longer than any other simply because it is the easiest to upgrade and repair. Hard drives can be replaced, RAM can be added as needed, and the internal battery can be replaced after losing its ability to hold a charge. The processor is roughly 15% faster than the one inside the Macbook Air, which also extends this computer's usable lifespan.The fact that the screen is fairly low-res for the price (MBP 13 has a res of 1280x800, while other windows laptops have a res of 1600x900 for the same price), really detracts from my personal experience with the computer. The retina display of my iPhone 5 has indeed spoiled me, and Apple should update the screen of the MBP 13 or bring down the price of the retina model. This, added with the fact that the speed of the hard drive is very slow for the money, detracts from the computer's value. Lowering the price by one hundred dollars would justify the hard drive and screen and make the computer a five-star purchase, but for the price, this is a four star (good) computer. Those looking to drop $1200 on a new laptop will have to decide if the upgradability and processor performance is worth the money over the sleeker MacBook Air. In addition, if Mac OSX is not something you enjoy using, then I would advise that you look elsewhere for a laptop.TLDR version: good, reliable laptop with mediocre screen and slow hard drive."

Personally 8 is enough for me (for now)- the screen is super clear and crisp. I have a retina display iPad and I can't tell the difference.- if you do any gaming I would suggest you get this over the retina because they have the same GPU but the retina display has more pixels to power so you'll get better better frame rates with this one.- the retina display may be nice for photographers but this model has an edge for basically every other task.- when your watching video you won't be able to tell the difference between this and the retina.- built in DVD drive! I still love this feature call me old school but I still use it, and I'm not old either I'm in my twenties.- if you no longer have a use for the DVD drive you can take it out and put in a second SSD OR HDD. They make a kit you can get really cheap on Amazon. Can't do that with a retina.- with bootcamp you get the best of both worlds OS 10 and windows.- great for gaming I've been running Far Cry 3 and Fallout New Vegas and it has plenty of power to spare.My criticisms- I really can't think of any. I wish apple would add a touch screen that would make this the perfect laptop.The bottom lineIf your looking for a mobile powerhouse that is user upgradeable, and the quality that can only come from apple this is the computer for you. This is still the real MacBook Pro in my opinion. If you want a design that is tried and true and don't want to spend your life savings on a maxed out retina model (because you can't upgrade them) still like having a DVD  drive and other practical ports give this one serious consideration."

Before I begin, I will say that I am not like a good percentage of the people that will end up writing a review on this computer - I am not an Apple fanboy. I have owned many PC computers as well, and like them too. I currently own a Lenovo laptop as well as my new MacBook Pro, and each have their own strengths and weaknesses.To start with the strengths:1. OSX Lion is a great performer..extremely fast and reliable. I have it installed on my iMac desktop computer as well and love it. Not to mention this comes with a free upgrade to Mountain Lion, which is very nice.2. Screen looks great. Even though it is not the Retina display you can get on the 15.4 inch model, the screen is fantastic. Very bright and crystal clear with excellent color.3. Quietest laptop I have ever owned. Keeps quiet even when the computer is under a heavy load.4. First computer I have owned with USB 3.0. I bought an external hard drive when I purchased this laptop as well so I could utilize the USB 3.0. I got the hard drive yesterday and transferred all of my files from my old laptop to the new hard drive so I could put them on my MacBook. It took about 1/5th of the time it did with USB 2.0.5. My Lenovo laptop does not have an illuminated keyboard, so the keyboard on this laptop is a big plus in my opinion. Excellent for people that like to work or surf the web while their significant other is sleeping.6. The trackpad - can't even compare it to any trackpad I have seen on any other laptop computer.7. Excellent battery life while being a very fast performer. It definitely has the best of both worlds. I average about 6 hours on a charge. My Lenovo (with similar graphics, processor, etc. and same use) only lasts about 4 or 5 hours on a full charge.8. Typical Apple simplistic styling. I love the look of the Apple products. Simple and clean.9. Many, many more...but those are the most notable ones to me.Now, for the weaknesses.1. The only thing I dislike about this laptop are the rubber pads found on the bottom of the computer for grip. They may get softer and more sticky as time goes by, but right now they are far from that. The pads on the bottom of my Lenovo are definitely much better and don't allow the computer to slide around while I am using the computer on a glass topped desk.2. Price - it's a bit pricey for the performance you get, but the added perks of Mac OSX and the durability and support of Apple products makes up for it. For the same price, you can get a PC with more memory, larger hard drive, better graphics, and a faster processor, but then you remember you're running Windows 7, which isn't nearly as well built as Mac OSX.In conclusion - this is a great laptop. Although it is a little pricey, it is well worth the extra money. So far, the only issue I have with it (rubber pads) is a very small problem that does not change how this laptop performs in any way.If you are thinking about getting a MacBook Pro laptop but do not want to spend a huge amount of money for one, this is definitely the way to go. It may be considered the &#34;base model&#34; MacBook Pro, but it still an excellent computer. The size and battery life of this computer makes it excellent for people that need a laptop that is very mobile. Between work and college classes, I needed a lightweight yet durable computer and this definitely fits that criteria."

The iMac is still functioning for the kids and still works great after 8 years. The issue is we can no longer upgrade to the newest version of OSX thus we don't get the benefits of the new features. The new MBP offers great portability and gives us confidence that we are not going to need to purchase a new laptop in 18 months. Something we did often when we purchased Windows based laptops.Apple OSX is simple to use and has a more enjoyable and intuitive interface than the new Windows 8. I'm not saying it's for everyone but it's a great solution if you want a simple to use device that you know won't be at the end of it's life cycle in a couple of years.Pros-Great functionality-Integration with iCloud and many of the apps you use on an iPad and iPhone.-Log battery life even with wifi on and streaming movies via netflix-Very durable unibody case-Still has an optic drive-Mag Safe power cord is a nice touch-Intel i5 processor works very well-The chicklet keyboard is AWESOME!-The single best function is the backlit keyboard. There is nothing worse than trying to work on a plane and not being able to see the keys without an overhead light that blinds you.-The track pad is incredible. I'm a person that will not use a laptop without a mouse. I just don't like trackpad's because they never work right. That is until now. I can easily use the Apple Track Pad without any issues and now I don't even travel with a mouse. My bag just got a little lighter. I do however like the Apples Magic Mouse but I really don't need it.-It just works. We found that out when our new MBP found all the office and home printers, installed drivers and started working with no effort on our part.Cons-Heavy compared to Ultrabook laptopsRecommendations: I would definitely recommend 8 Gigabytes of RAM. Just because the processor is a 64bit architecture and can efficiently utilize the RAM. I wouldn't by the factory RAM just because it's expensive. Amazon has a nice selection of RAM from various suppliers that will work. We went with the Corsair Vengeance 8GB (2x4GB) DDR3 1600 MHz (PC3 12800) Laptop Memory (CMSX8GX3M2A1600C9).If you have never installed RAM in a Mac Laptop go out on YouTube and watch a couple of videos. It's very easy to do but it's nice to have someone walk you through it first to get a little confidence."

The first one we received began to experience problems around day six of usage. The optical drive would not function properly and it would not run any kind of disc. We followed the return, exchange policy on the Amazon website, and found it to be a very simple process. Amazon issued a call tag to UPS who came to pick up the return with a label. We had saved all of the packaging just in case there was an issue and we boxed everything up the way it was when we received it. UPS came , slapped on the label gave us a tracking slip and off it went. In the meantime, Amazon sent out the replacement which we received in a matter of a few days. We also could track the return via UPS and saw when it was delivered to someone in Kentucky, and could even see who signed for it. It was quite easy. The second laptop is working fine. My daughter seems to think it is much quieter, and she loves how much faster it is than her old pc which by the way was a Dell that we paid quite a bit for a few years back, but developed like so many others who owned this same laptop an issue with bad hinges. This Macbook is solid, one piece, smartly designed, and very user friendly. It took a bit of getting used to as it is different than windows, but my daughter says she will never go back......She loves it."

After trying this for about a half hour and trying to use this POS with a monitor attached the hard drive failed and I got the contact Apple support grey window (aka mac's Grey screen of death).  I restarted it and it could not boot any partition from my hardrive or even see it.

The Apple notebooks fit the requests and the nephews could not be more happier.

Won't charge, won't start. Datavision (Amazon's reseller - you're not getting it straight from Amazon) informed me that I could take it to a local Apple Store for a 'replacement,' which is simply incorrect. An Apple Store would attempt to repair this same unit under warranty. My other option was to mail it, insured, AT MY OWN EXPENSE, back to Datavision for an exchange.Extremely disappointed both with the product and the experience buying it from Amazon. I advise buying direct from Apple or choosing a different authorized reseller than Amazon's 'Datavision' retailer.Anyway, I've elected to have the Apple Store attempt to repair the unit. I may update the review as the adventure progresses.UPDATE 1/10/13! The Apple Store sent it off under warranty, and it returned in just a couple of days with a new logic board and magsafe (power charger) component in the laptop.SCREEN -Noticeably brighter than my 2006 matte screen MacBook Pro. I was worried about the glossy, reflective screen, but inside at least it's perfect. I have yet to attempt to use it outside. No dead pixels. Great color. No issues.PERFORMANCE, HEAT & NOISE -Very fast. The 2.6 GHz processor, 8 MB of RAM and the 1 gig NVidia 650M graphics card all make a zippy machine. I also like the fact that it has an additional on-board graphics card, and automatically switches between the two as needed to extend battery life and reduce heat output. Overall, runs much, much cooler than my 2006 MacBook Pro.The traditional magnetic hard drive suits my needs just fine - no need for an expensive SSD. This machine lets me edit large photos in Photoshop CS5 quickly and easily, with little to no delay in rendering.The hard drive is very quiet. The optical drive machinery makes more noise than I expected when it takes in a disc, but it reads CDs/DVDs quietly and effectively once it gets started.BODY -The unibody construction really does feel lot more solid than Apple's previous laptops. The screen hinge works well and appears durable.OVERALL RECOMMENDATION -4/5. It's a great machine. Get it if you can afford it. Buy it from Amazon direct, not from another reseller.Why not 5/5? Mine arrived with a dead logic board and no ability to charge the battery--a $2,000 brick. The Apple warranty got it repaired for free in just a couple of days, however. I bought AppleCare and would not be surprised if other parts need replacement over the next three years, just as my previous MacBook Pro had its logic board, topcase, hard drive, battery, and optical drive replaced through Applecare. Apple seems to periodically have bad batches of logic boards, but according to the other customer reviews on Amazon I just got a lemon and the vast majority work perfectly."

I am pleased with my decision, however I have only had this for a few weeks. There are a few things I am dissappointed with though. Only 2 USB ports. Most Windows laptops have 2 to 4 or more. No HDMI port. Most Windows laptops have at least 1. The headphones jack is a combo jack for the headphones and microphone. Not a big deal for me, but if you Skype a lot or are gaming a regular headphone set with a separate jack for the headphone sound and microphone input will not work on a Mac.

The touchscreen....it looks like the Apple OS, but does things faster, easier, and intuitive, and is alot faster than my initial startup on the Mac Pro.... Kinda Gentle....If you are going to drop a big dime.....Think carefully.  Another of my issues was that I wanted to transfer my DOS stuff from XP...Pics, music  and soforth...wasn't sure about about Mac....Those tiny buttons tho were the deal killer.Good luck in your search....I have Kumbyaaa in my house....:)Good luckMark"

I bought this Mac book pro along with a new 27' iMac & while they are still light years more reliable than a PC I have noticed a decline in the reliability of my Mac computers. The problem for me has been all with memory (ram) even with the ram maxed out on both computers I every once in a while have it lock up while editing photos (professional photographer) at first I thought aperture 3 was the problem, I switched over to Lightroom and there was a noticeable improvement but the problem remains. I have brought both in for service a number of times.- there was an issue with the seal on the monitor which caused dust to get under the screen- there was a problem with the screen refusing to wake from sleep modeEvery time apple handles the problem & fixes it for free. Apple products generally work out the small issues on their own, you only get problems when it's something big. Fortunately apples customer service is great.While I had my MacBook in for service I used my husbands HP laptop (similar specs) and there were many more quirks so overall I'm still happy with my purchase - apple still beats out windows/bios systems hands down but I would be lying if I said I wasn't concerned about the seemingly obvious decrease in quality over the years. I buy a new Mac every 2-3 years for work. With the needs of a professional photographer I generally need to keep up with the best specs. I've never had a pc live longer than that. I choose to upgrade, I don't have to. My first PowerBook stillWorks!"

I found it toughest to decide between Dell ultra books and Apple. There is nothing wrong in Dell but I preferred Apple 13.4&#34; Display 500 GB Hard Drive, 4 GB memory and Intel Core i5 Processor (3rd gen).. This is best laptop.Advantages:1. Although there  is a small learning curve for Mac OS to get some hands on - but as I am familiar with Linux I am very comfortable with Mac OS... this is the only thing I see difficult with Mac Book .... and this is advantage in other sense coz you will be amazingly in a new world of OS and features...... and even if you are too restricted to MS Windows, you still can have partitions and Windows installed virtually or through boot camp... with all native speed...2. Macs never crash... I never see any application taking too much to respond and going nasty ....and same applications I saw going goofy on my other laptop which carries Windows with similar hardware.3. There are no issues at all with internet security and virus attacks... I don't even have any anti-virus ...4. If you are restricted to Word processing applications like MS Word, Excel, PowerPoint, you can have MS Office on Mac just in $119... but if you are not restricted but still want this capability, Open-office can solve all your problems...5. You can make Mac virtually same as Windows if you are Microsoft fan.... I am also Microsoft fan and doing the same....6. Incredible display, laptop size and weight.... great battery backup...7. accept trusted content only e.g. tools, software etc.8. No other brand has touch pad like Mac .... you don't even need lot of keys from keyboard or mouse when you have MacBook touch pad with youDisadvantages:1. Cost is more as compared to other brands. Other brands can come with higher configurations in same cost.... but Mac is Mac2. learning curve for OS and other features3. less free stuff compared to other communities... accept programs from trusted developers only"

I still have to use my two other windows machines to get most of my work done because, as much of a pleasure as the Mac is to use, it's not worth re-purchasing of a ton of software. One thing I am still happy about is the price I paid at Amazon. I had been watching the prices for six months and a brick and mortar store (rhymes with Test Fry) put it on sale the week of Thanksgiving. Amazon's prices can change by the minute and for about two hours, the price dropped as low as it had ever been and matched the Test Fry price. Even though I can't use it for work much, I am still glad I made the purchase. The best features to me are the multiple desktops, the swipe gestures, and the seamless way they work together. Also, the way it works with Apple TV is nothing short of amazing. The more Apple products you have, the more it sense it makes to acquire more. And lets face it, reading these reviews isn't really going to sway you on the product, only on where you purchase it. And with my Amazon Prime membership (the best $79 I've spent in years) buying it here was a no-brainer. $3.99 got it here overnight. Any repairs are going to have to be made by Apple anyway and who wants to deal with a pretentious &#34;Apple Genius&#34;. I prefer &#34;Google Genius&#34;. Oh, and a Book Book is worth the price. They sell that here too."

The ones that overheated and died an early death. Also based on my past excellent experience with mac computers I did not purchase an extended warranty. My MacBook Pro died about a month ago and I almost did not get another one. Unfortunately I had become a mac addict because when a Mac works it works very well. My Windows based computers were always crashing, usually about every three months. The worst a Mac ever did to me was freeze up.My new Macbook Pro arrived yesterday. I normally DO NOT write a review until after I have used an item and on a computer I wait 3 months. I am breaking that rule today because there has been some IMPORTANT CHANGES that I feel people need to know about especially those folks like me who have had a bad experience with this line of macs.This Macbook Pro RUNS FAR COOLER than any mac I have ever owned EVEN WHEN THEY WERE NEW. This might be because of the new i5 processor. It might be because Apple re-engineered them and cured whatever it was that caused the problem. I don't know. All I know is that even my longest lasting macs always ran fairly warm and that 2010 model ran hot all the time. In my opinion this should make these new macs run far longer than the old ones especially if you get the solid state drive( I did not).This Macbook Pro has my other Macs beat on speed even when they were new.I will update this review and report any problems I come across. If you see no updates it's good news. One thing is for sure. With this Mac I am purchasing the extended warranty through Squaretrade. Apples warranty is too expensive and only runs 3 years. At one time they offered 5 years. The Squaretrade warranty goes up to 4 years and is about $50 cheaper."

A laptop provides easy access to Internet resources and keeping track of assignments that need to be due. Many modern homework assignments require using Internet or having to do research for classes. The Apple 13-inch MacBook Pro laptop is very practical for college students because of its easy to use features, fast performance, and new modern design. Often homework assignments require using a computer, which the MacBook Pro assists with because it provides Internet that can give information for research. In my opinion, Safari, the Internet browser that comes with the MacBook Pro is very fast and is extremely easy to use. As a result of having user-friendly features, Safari has a top sites page that contains frequently used websites. Also, in addition to top sites, there is unified smart search field that takes you right to the web page and fills in the entire URL when you enter a web address. MacBook's built-in sharing feature provides access to various web pages without having to leave Safari. By just clicking the Share button, you can choose how to send a web page by using Mail, which then gives you four options. Also the MacBook Pro has a fast performance that helps college students complete their work. The MacBook Pro provides many features, such as a dual-core Intel Core i5 that allows users to be able to take their laptops on the go. Also it has a 22-nanometer processor, cache, and graphics processor, and a fast 1600MHz memory controller on a single chip. Also applications like Aperture and Final Cut Pro help make work go smoother and faster because they automatically increase the speed of the active cores up to 3.7GHz. Hyper-threading technology allows two threads to run at the same time on each core and can get more jobs done. In addition to its high-quality features, it has an amazing new modern design that adds to the MacBook's overall easy usage. The new design contributes to assisting college students in need of getting work done because of its LED backlight technology that makes the display continuously bright. Also, on top of the screen is the built-in FaceTime HD camera that can be used to talk face to face through the laptop to loved ones or friends. The multi-touch trackpad is the button itself, which results in more room to click everywhere, which personally is nice because it is easier to double click when needed. Another valuable feature of design is the MagSafe Power Adapter's magnetic design, which is made to disconnect harmlessly from the port in case someone trips over the wire so it does not cause the laptop to fall. In conclusion, the 13-inch MacBook Pro is a wise investment for college students and any users interested in an easy-to-use productive laptop to help get work done. Having a portable computer is beneficial because it provides a place to store various information. Students looking for an all-in-one tool that can assist them in numerous aspects should definitely look into the Apple MacBook Pro laptop line. Its easy to use features, quick performance, and sleek design all contribute to the MacBook's overall productivity."

I was extremely happy with the OS itself. It does not take as long to learn as I expected. After a few hours of usage however, I was having issues with it. The fan was at 6000rpm and the CPU usage was high. I am an Info Sys major in college, so I started researching this issue on my own. I found a solution but I was lacking files required to do it, so I gave in and called Apple. I told them that I just received my brand new MacBook but I was having issues. He looked up the serial number and told me it isn't new; that someone had registered my MacBook with Apple Care 50 days ago.When I ordered this, there was no mention that I was ordering a used/refurbished product. I refuse to buy used technology. Hopefully my replacement is brand new.

It took 3 days to make an appointment at the local Apple store. I'm not sure what happened next but she came back home crying with a piece of paper in her hand $129 for a new battery, $39 to replace it and $139 for a new keyboard. I could not believe they did not consider the battery as defective so I went to the Apple store myself and asked for a manager.  He explained to me the battery expansion is 'normal'.  Apple doesn't cover battery expansion under any circumstances not even under their Apple Care.  The battery is simply considered 'consumable' and NOT covered.I asked the manager if he feels comfortable with me posting the picture of the MacBook Air on the internet with the description that Apple doesn't consider the product defective.  His reply astonished me, looking down at me behind his thick glasses he said: 'Make sure you have your facts straight before you smear! They will contact you.'  He didn't specify who are 'they' but from the tone of his voice and his 6'5' posture it indicated something between the SWAT team and a bunch of LAWYERS.Here is my take on all of this, the business model Apple pushes right now is to get some cheap junk from China, hire a bunch of cheerleaders straight out of high school, call them geniuses, and bully everybody who complains about their product.

HD graphics, clean and stylish look, built very well, and it even runs on the same internet in the same house almost 3x as fast as my pc and even picks up more signal from the access points than my pc....yea wont say all is great though the whole holding ctrl+left click was a little annoying. had to ask a guy in starbucks how to do it then i learned the double finger click but all in all this mac is awesome. webistires even look better on this thing. im only using this for business basically so Im hoping for some good years with no big problems...total 5 stars on this. full recommendation....probably should have checked apples sight before i bought here but oh well i love it anyway. new box and everything."

I used windows XP, windows Vista, and Windows 7 extensively. Most recently, I put Windows 8 on my old Dell laptop in an attempt to breathe new life into it. This plan ended when the hinge holding the screen on finally gave out. I purchased this computer from Amazon during the Black Friday sale, and got a much better deal than Apple was offering. Though the computer ships with Lion instead of the current Mountain Lion OS, the free upgrade that Amazon describes was processed and approved by Apple within about 10 minutes. The computer arrived very well packaged and in perfect condition.Hardware: The Macbook pro's physical form is wonderful. Not only is it beautiful, but it feels really solid. Screen is bright and gorgeous. Trackpad is nothing short of dazzling when compared to competing Windows systems. Wake up time is very short. Sound from concealed speakers perfectly adequate for normal listening.Software: Though I was excited to try Mac, I was a little apprehensive. I have been a PC person for many years and feel really comfortable navigating Windows to accomplish tasks. Not only is Mac different, but Mac programs (in my experience) typically expect you to think in a slightly different way when trying to figure out how to do something new. I was a bit worried that I would experience some frustration. My fears, however, were unfounded. The system is amazingly intuitive, and, after a short learning curve, you begin to feel like Mac is a big improvement over Windows 7, and that Windows 8 is an unsuccessful attempt to recreate Mac successes. For example, I feel like the new Start screen is analogous to the Launchpad, but more cluttered and a bit clunky. Anyway, the transition is not difficult, and the experience trumps Windows easily.WHY THE MACBOOK PRO, WHY NOT THE AIR? I did consider purchasing the Air instead of the Pro. I was attracted to the all flash architecture of the air. Solid state drives don't wear out, even after 5+ years of operation. Also, lugging around a heavy computer just in case I need it is a peeve of mine, with the result that I often don't have my computer when I need it. The Pro is by no means a heavy computer, but the Air is remarkably light. I don't really believe I would have ever missed the optical drive, as I still have a desktop that I can use to burn CDs/DVDs and to store massive files that would overwhelm the relatively small solid state storage of the Air. Why, then, did I get the Pro? Longevity for one. I expect a laptop to last around 5 years at this point. While the base Pro and Air have similar performance ratings, in two years I can open the bottom of the Pro and easily and cheaply upgrade the RAM. I also plan to put in a solid state drive at that time. This can all be done more cheaply than paying Apple for the upgrade right now. Also, though I understand why it may be reasonable to make the Air without an Ethernet cable, my office at the university does not have Wifi. There are no plans to expand coverage to my office and I am not permitted to expand the network on my own. This means I am restricted to ethernet connection. I realize that there are USB and Thunderbolt adapters for this, but I would need to use this adapter literally every day. In the end, I don't think it would be worth the hassle. Also, some users report issues with getting the Air to use these adapters, a situation which would be extremely negative for my work situation even on a short-term basis. In the end, these reasons led me to get the Pro over the Air, and I am highly satisfied with my decision. The relatively greater mass of the Pro is not an issue, as the computer is still highly portable, and not having to mess with the ethernet adapter is a pro that I am already grateful for.Overall, my experience with this computer has been great. I would highly recommend the switch, and I will not be returning to the Windows platform for the foreseeable future."

Also, the laptop is quite, no more burnt laps, best screen display, and small additions like backlit keyboard wins your heart over. Considered MAcBook Air also before buying this Pro, but glad bought the Pro, because I didn't fancy carrying a bunch of adapters, separate DVD player etc.....Honestly didn't see too much difference visually between this screen and the retina display, so didn't fancy paying that much premium for retina, others may fancy that, I didn't.Compared other ultrabooks like Zenbook and the price were very comparable but none of them carry the reputation of Mac, so stuck with MacbookOnly thing I dislike is that everything for Mac is expensive but I guess you pay for quality!"

They are great and seem to be able to do just about anything.The new operating system makes this computer into a super iPad.  It does just about everything an iPad does except a forward facing camera BUT adds the feature of having a keyboard.  Yes it is bigger, requires a little more time to startup but I believe that the keyboard and actually having a real working computer make up for those two things.  You use the pad on the computer instead of on the screen on the iPad but they seem to work exactly the same.  Try typing on an iPad and then on one of these computers.  No comparison.  Until screens are developed enough on iPads to allow for quick data entry they will never be more than a viewing machine.  Not that that is bad but it is limited.A word of advice, when installing hardware like a printer or additional monitor DO NOT use the disk that came with them.  I did for my epson printer and that required me to call epson and they had to help clear out what had been installed.  Apparently this computer is smart enough to recognize just about any piece of hardware.  It also recognized my viewsonic monitor.The screen is clear, the keyboard lights up, you have the ability to upload your software to the cloud so that you can safely access it later.  It has the ability if you let Apple to locate it if it gets lost or stolen.  It does automatic backups either to the cloud or a drive or a stick storage.  Dang I think this computer is neat and very powerful.  It is even spell checking as I type here.BUTIt is expensive, with applecare, microsoft office and a vga adapter it ran almost $2k.As neat as this computer is do I need all this power.  If you are a student or employee that has schedules, needs to take notes or just needs to use all the very useful and very powerful tools that are included then I can see it for you.  Me, I am a physically broken 68 year old whose dell computer broke on him.  I use it for getting on the internet, playing games, watching a few movies while on the go and lastly to do a few spreadsheets and write some letters.  This computer is way overkill for me.  Will I keep it?  Sure, it does all that I want.  If Dell had been more helpful than I probably would have bought another one.  But since they weren't and I have always wanted to try an Apple I got this.If you really want to buy an Apple, I would suggest that you buy it here on Amazon, or a least another site like it.  You can buy the hardware, software, Applecare warranty and accessories.  It is cheaper here than from Apple.  A fact that I learned after calling apple and ordering from them."

This would have been my third - a gift for my wife. I tried to recalibrate several times with no luck. A little research revealed others having similar issues. Apparently, Apple is using 3 different vendors to produce the panels, each having varying contrast/color IQs - aka the 'panel roulette.'Comparing this side-by-side with my 2011, 13' Macbook Pro was like night and day. My 2011 has great contrast and is so easy on the eyes. This 2012 has marginally better contrast than my 2010 kindle, which is certainly not a good thing with a backlit screen.What annoys me the most is that Apple is losing a grip on QC. They claim to calibrate each screen individually; and they should considering the entrance fee for these books. No way this thing should have been let out of the factory.My advice is to do a little research and consider purchasing in person to verify the contrast, color and quality of the screen you're purchasing."

I have used this product for only 2 days, but I can't wait to use it more. I really like Mac/Apple products because of their operating system. I have been a Linux (Ubuntu and Fedora) user for a while because Windows doesn't appeal to me and it is similar to Ubuntu and Fedora but with trackpad gestures, notification center, and I can run iTunes (I couldn't get it to run on Linux). I can tweet and use Facebook from the sidebar which is really nice. I also like I have the option to push calendars, photos, and contacts to an iPad, iPod Touch, or iPhone (if I had any of those).The only thing I have had trouble with so far is transferring music to iTunes which I would have liked to do though &#34;Home Sharing&#34; (I used iTunes on a computer separate from my Linux computer) but I could not figure that out. I just ended up using my iPod to transfer my iTunes music and I re-downloaded my Amazon music (losing my ratings). I would recommend this product to anyone having trouble typing on their iOS products, though there are cheaper options; any new computer users, as it is easy to learn; and anyone who needs to be efficient, as the gestures make it very easy to multitask.

I would say that 85% of the design industry is Mac for good reason. When you work on a PC with design software, it goes kerplunk. Yes. Still. After all these years.Why not the air?Unless you are between 2 and 4 years old, weight just isn't as big of an issue as people and Apple make it out to be.In the real world, performance is the bigger bang for the buck, especially if you install an SSD or hybrid drive in it. Oh, by the way, yes. You can upgrade it. want to upgrade an Air? Too bad. Tough nuts. No way. Sorry Charlie.I would rate the 13' macbook pro as 4 star simply because of the integrated graphics card. Other than that, it's aces.More good news is the resale value is on pretty much all Macs is so high. You can spend $$$ on a mac, and 3 years later still get $$. Better yet, run it for 8 YEARS!

(Available from Amazon.)Included with this computer is iMovie 11, but NO WAY to make a DVD of your movie.As compared to my previous MacBook, the changes are as follows:1)  The battery is no longer user replaceable. This means the computer has to be taken to the shop for repair.  This also means you probably will want remove all of your data from the hard drive for security reasons prior to servicing.  My previous MacBook allowed replacement of the internal battery in 10 seconds, with no tools.2)  OS 10.8 is definitely 'dumbed down' as compared with 10.6.  10.8 now has 'Windows like' hidden files (this can be disabled).3)  'Bounce' has been removed from the Apple Mail program.  'Bounce' is a great tool to let people know you don't want any further e-mails from them.  ( Third parties have a fix for this defect also.)4)  No installation disk (DVD) is included. This means that should you need to repair or rebuild your computer you are absolutely dependent on the existence and availability of Apple's servers.  You cannot repair your machine without Internet access.  Many experts advise creating your own installation disk (DVD) to make up for this mistake. I intend to do this.5)  No more 'Save As'.  This has been replaced with a more complicated 'duplicate' feature. Less intuitive and a higher workload.6)  The default security settings intimidate you into thinking that downloading software from anywhere other than the Apple Store is less secure. This setting can be changed to take the computer out of 'nanny mode'.  I suspect in the future, Macs will become like iPhones so that only software from the Apple Store can be installed.6)  I like the lighted keyboard and the built-in DVD drive. I would never purchase a computer without an optical drive.This computer is still superior to anything running Windows.  However, it is definitely a downgrade from previous MacBook models."

For personal reasons, I needed hands on.  One reason that I can share is that I had been an MS user for years ... and put up with the many frustrations associated with MS.  The latest frustration was having a certain brand of laptop, a gift, that was less than two years old suddenly go black screen, only the power light lit and then 7 beeps, a short interval, and more of the 7 beeps (I thought I was in a vehicle backing up).  I took it to the store.  They didn't even open it up but looked up the beep code which says that it is a processor failure.  They handed it back to me and said that it would cost more to repair than to replace ... PERIOD (and more to retrieve any data).  I then found that in a matter of a few weeks since the new OS came out that there were just a few machines left with Windows 7, some being the last item on the shelf.  I was given a demonstration of Windows 8.  I nearly had a 'melt down.' It was overwhelming!!!  If you have any handicap, i.e. visual, it is worse.  But, that's just my opinion.  BTW, I checked online regarding the old laptop that 'died' and found that I was not alone, far from it.  I found a number of people with the same laptop a year to less than two years old that had the same sudden failure.  Some had replaced the processor without any change.  I was told that it seems to be a multi - component failure.  One upset person said that the company knew of the problem and was doing nothing about it.  I won't say which brand but I was not going to be a ding dong and go back to more grief and certainly not put up with Windows 8.  The advertisements are great ... but I did not find the reality good for me.  I never used a Mac before.  But, when I got it home, I looked at a few videos online and was using it without much difficulty in a short time.  Hooking up to my WiFi and wireless all-in-one printer was almost like talking to the Mac and telling it to hook up by itself.  What would have been a 'grand process' with a device using MS was a breeze for me on the Mac, the guy who never used a Mac before. I'm happy!"

I was (and still am) of the mindset that Apple products are overpriced; however, I do understand that quality is better than quantity and w/Apple you are paying for quality. After my 3rd pc crashed in a little of 5yrs, I decided to cough up the money and make the switch. Haven't regretted it one bit. This machine is A-mazing. No complaints at all. I was worried that it would take a long time for me to get used to the Mac OS but it took me a day or so of playing w/it to get comfortable. Granted I'm sure I don't know all the ends and outs but that will come in time. The best thing for me is that everything I wished I could change/add to a PC this macbook pro has - faster boot up times, longer battery life, it even has more customization than I realized, and the camera is way ahead of any pc that I had. Let it be known that I do not write reviews often...kind of a hypocrite about that (won't take the time to write em but love reading em), but i digress.

However, after having several other Apple devices over the years and enjoying the lack of errors and problems with the devices and the OS's, I gave it more consideration as I approached buying my very first laptop (after having over 20 years experience on desktop PC's).  I saved about $300 buying it on Amazon rather than elsewhere (no sales tax, big discount and $3.99 overnight shipping with Prime). The machine is brand new and it came installed with the Mountain Lion OS.The screen is excellent, it boots up fast. USB 3.0 is very fast. The trackpad works far better than I had anticipated. The gestures are amazing. The OS is very different than Windows, but is not hard to navigate. I store my regular 'Work in Process' documents on Dropbox, so those were a cinch to pull over. I still have to migrate my pictures and music to the machine. All of my bookmarks in Safari that I created over the years on the iPad pulled over seamlessly. The integration with my other Apple products via iCloud is outstanding.Everything from the box, the instructions, initial setup, downloading and installing software, the navigation of the OS....it all has a consistent and polished look.  Before i bought this I felt like I was getting the 'low end' laptop from Apple. After using it for a few days I am in awe of the performance and design.

Boot time is super fast, around anywhere from 35 seconds to 1 minute. Apps launch super fast, and the 500GB HDD is more than sufficient. I usually use my Mac for school work and internet browsing, so the entry-level 13' MacBook Pro is already more than what I expected from a computer I would typically use it for. Macs hardly ever get viruses, and they are completely incompatible with existing Microsoft Windows Viruses. Furthermore, Mac OS X Mountain Lion's Gate keeper prevents the user from downloading malware and trojans, which keep your data safe and your computer running at optimum speed. The keys on the keyboard are evenly spaced and are back-lit, which make it easy to use at night and for speed writing (Typing?). Overall, the screen resolution, though non-retina, is sufficient for normal web browsing and work. I still don't get why retina displays are standard on most new iOS devices, but are only available on the MacBook Pro with Retina Display (Total cheapskate!). The thunderbolt port is awesome! It's 10gbps transfer speeds surpass even the super-fast USB 3.0 (Which also comes with the MBP). US 3.0 comes with the MBP and has transfer rates of up to 5gbps. Other ports include FireWire 800, Gigabit Ethernet, MagSafe port, Microphone jack. SDHC card reader and an optical drive for burning and reading discs.The glass track pad is large enough for Apple's highly acclaimed multi-touch gestures for scrolling through web pages with two fingers, zooming in on certain parts of certain apps by double tapping with two fingers, accessing launchpad by pinching with five fingers and using mission control by swiping up with four fingers.You can also buy one of Apple's magic mice, which connect to your Mac using Bluetooth, and also allows you to use certain multi-touch gestures such as zoom and scroll.For Windows users switching to a Mac, you can also enable right clicking (known to apple as secondary click) in the system preferences> Mouse and enabling right clicking.The unique to apple aluminium uni-body is a real beauty. It makes the MBP very durable and protects it from scratches, though you shouldn't go launching it against a wall for the sake of trying it.For Windows users who are used to using Microsoft Office, you can buy a license for the latest Microsoft Office software for Mac (Currently 2011) at any of apple's retail stores, Apple Authorised resellers, any store that sells Microsoft Office for Mac or downloading the software directly from Microsoft's website.*Users without an optical drive can skip the installation of Microsoft Office and head to the next section*To install the software, simply insert the disc provided in the package into the optical drive and open and install all the files.Enter your code printed on the back of your CD sleeve when prompted.Done! Enjoy using Microsoft Office!*For those without an optical drive (MBP with Retina Display and MB air), read this. Users with and optical drive can skip this section*To download Microsoft Office, go to Microsoft's website and download the trial version. When prompted, enter your code printed on the back of your CD sleeve to unlock the full potential of Microsoft Office 2011 for Mac.The Mac app store and iTunes store are phenomenal. The Mac app store is your one-stop shop for Mac software, though you can also download software online at your own risk. There are currently around 10,000 apps on the App store (and counting...), and billions of songs available for download fro the iTunes store. iTunes is also you default (And also your only) media player besides DVD player, or any other media players you may come across on the internet. iTunes is one of the better media players available on the market with it's simple to use User Interface. Users switching from a PC will definitely prefer iTunes to Microsoft's Windows media player.Overall, the high price of the MacBook Pro may convince users to buy a cheaper Windows PC instead. But remember, you are paying a high premium for a product with better build quality and high quality software, which is a joy to work with, considering that you can finally work in peace without having to worry about the millions of Windows viruses out in the wild attacking countless careless and oblivious PC users. I'm sure you won't regret making this purchase."

Complete folly!  The bad experience started at the Apple Store.  I was told they could transfer data for me if I brought in my XPS.  'For how long?,' I asked.  'Several days.'  'Not acceptable.  I have work to do.  What if I brought the two folders I want to transfer on an external drive?'  'Fine.'  So I went home, updated the folders and came back.  'Oh, we can only transfer from another computer, not from a drive.'  So I purchased the computer and went home to set up and transfer data myself; I've never had any problems doing this in the past.  I get home again and go to archive and print-out my email receipt (which I need for an expense account).  The pdf would not open because of special Apple character sets and was just lines of splotches.  I went back a third time to the store to get a receipt.  The next day I opened the box and proceeded to set up.  After about an hour trying to work out how to assemble the two-piece power chord (no instructions) I got stuck on the data transfer stage; it could not recognize any connection to another computer or hard drive or flash drive.  I just decided I hated it and returned it for refund.  I remembered all my previous bad experiences with Apple: how terrible ITunes is, Apple library terminals on which it was impossible to back-page or scroll, and several lecturers I've seen humiliated because they brought their slide-show on an Apple, so could not connect to a digital projector (which apparently requires a mythical object called a 'dongle' which no human has ever seen).  I have nothing good to say about Windows, but at least I've learned since the PC was invented to use its various iterations, and it can send emails, text, pdfs to other computers and be hooked up to a projector.  I will never try another Apple product.  I don't want to spend hundreds of hours in Apple University learning its counter-intuitive products.

Applications also start slower, instead of almost all my apps opening instantly, it takes 2-3 seconds.  An easy fix to that will be an SSD which I should be getting November sometime and will update this with comparisons.- I compared my roommate's 2011 Macbook Pro 13' to my 2011 Macbook Air 13' before I sold it.  His looked much better, darker blacks, more saturated and warm.  My Air looked stale and not as detailed as his Pro. The resolution is only 1280x800 compared to the 1440x900 of the Macbook Air, but I kind of like that better because text is bigger and I don't have to squint as much(not that I did that much before).- The first time I typed my name and password for the Pro I noticed the keyboard is slightly stiffer. I can say I liked the Macbook Air's keyboard better, but not a lot to be bothered by it.  Having used it for a month now, I don't even notice it anymore.- Having no DVD drive for almost a year was amazing, but frustrating the few times when I needed it. The noise isn't loud when turning on the computer, shouldn't be enough to wake someone up in the same room that is sleeping. Now I can't move my Mac around as fast since it has more moving parts in it, but thats not a big deal for me.- Graphics are much improved.  The comparison Apple gives is 60% improvement over the previous generation, however I went from a 2011 Macbook Air to a 2012 Macbook Pro. I'm not sure if thats more than a 60% improvement as I don't have a 2012 Macbook Air to compare.  Lets just say with my Macbook Air I had to have the lowest settings on Starcraft 2 to play a 3v3 game online and it would still lag later on and dip below 20fps.  WIth my Macbook Pro I can have medium settings on a 3v3 and have a steady 50fps the whole game.  The only time I could have a steady 50fps on high settings was a 1v1 game. However, medium settings look 10x better than low(mainly from shaders), while high settings looks only 2x better than medium.  Other games like Portal 2, Left 4 Dead 2, Torchlight 2(Windows Boot Camp), League of Legends, Half LIfe 2 series, CS:GO, TF2 I could get almost the highest settings(usually excluding AA) and be smooth.  Converting video via Handbrake was also quicker on the Macbook Pro, I don't have a video for proof, but from what I remember it was at least 2x as fast.- I used my Macbook Air for everything including school, work, games, video, music, etc. So it was on my desk 90% of the time.  So naturally moving to a thicker and slightly heavier Macbook Pro had no affect on me.  Even when I use it on my lap while watching TV or helping someone on the XBOX with a game, it doesn't feel like a brick.- My biggest complaint on the Macbook Air was the placement of the mic.  It was right next to the exhaust vent, so when I was playing any game online and using Skype, the other person could hear the fan blasting at a full 6500 rpm.  The mic on the Macbook Pro is now above the 'esc' key and not right next to the fan, much better design decision.  I've played games online and people don't hear the fans anymore.- As I mentioned before, while playing a game on the Macbook Air the fans would climb to 6500 rpm fast and be very loud and quite hot to the touch in the upper left corner of the laptop.  The highest I've seen it on my Macbook Pro is 5300 rpm, and it doesn't always do that.  Strangely enough it would do that on Starcraft 2 then would dip down to about 3000 rpm during a game and I couldn't hear it anymore. So noise is reduced at least 50% and the heat is much better, now it doesn't feel hot but warm.- The USB ports are right next to each other on the left side which is fine by me since my laptop is on the left side of my desk, so everything is out of the way for me.  On my Macbook Air cords would come out of both directions and cause a mess sometimes.  Even if it was the same as the Macbook Air, wouldn't bother me much.  Just be sure to have a USB drive that isn't super thick or you can't fit another next to it.- I was restricted to 4gb of ram on the Macbook Air which I thought would be fine before purchasing.  However I was new to Macs and didn't know that OSX uses a lot more ram than Windows, which is fine because its a lot more responsive, I just wish I had known before hand.  For me, after booting up with no apps open it was taking around 2gb or half the ram already.  Windows used around 500mb-750mb with no apps open.  So if I were playing a game, I couldn't have any other programs open or it would run slower.  I also had to keep track on how many tabs I had open in Chrome or Safari, especially if they had flash content like Youtube.  With 8gb of ram I can have Safari running with several tabs, Mail, Spotify, Preview, Textedit, and Steam open while playing Starcraft 2 and it doesn't slow down at all.- Another random note to mention is the screen bezel is black and not white. I kind of like the black better, especially when playing a game or watching video when the screen is darker.Overall I am extremely satisfied with my purchase and can't wait to get a 256gb SSD and watch this thing fly.That is really the only thing I miss from my last Macbook Air.Will edit my post when I get an SSD and if I find other things I forgot to mention.Hope this review was informative!"

It took 3 days to make an appointment at the local Apple store. I'm not sure what happened next but she came back home crying with a piece of paper in her hand $129 for a new battery, $39 to replace it and $139 for a new keyboard. I could not believe they did not consider the battery as defective so I went to the Apple store myself and asked for a manager.  He explained to me the battery expansion is 'normal'.  Apple doesn't cover battery expansion under any circumstances not even under their Apple Care.  The battery is simply considered 'consumable' and NOT covered.I asked the manager if he feels comfortable with me posting the picture of the MacBook Air on the internet with the description that Apple doesn't consider the product defective.  His reply astonished me, looking down at me behind his thick glasses he said: 'Make sure you have your facts straight before you smear! They will contact you.'  He didn't specify who are 'they' but from the tone of his voice and his 6'5' posture it indicated something between the SWAT team and a bunch of LAWYERS.Here is my take on all of this, the business model Apple pushes right now is to get some cheap junk from China, hire a bunch of cheerleaders straight out of high school, call them geniuses, and bully everybody who complains about their product.  Steve Jobs is dead, so is Apple.No more Apple devices in my household.  Please Google 'MacBook battery bulge explode' before you buy your next Apple toy."

(Update October 2013)","UPDATE:Two weeks shy of 1 year -- and thus almost out of warranty -- the logic board blew again. Counting the one this came with, this was the fourth to go down. Apple finally threw in the towel, and replaced the unit.  While I appreciate this, it is something that should have been done after the first replacement failed. Apple's failure to respond appropriately cost me not only time, but a significant amount of money lost when commitments couldn't be met (backing-up work means little, I've found, when you don't have a place to recover it to. Repair turnaround on this laptop averaged a week or more.) As I see it, Apple had an identified problem (witness similar complaints across the web) and their delay in acknowledging that this problem was not 'fixable' was not just inconsiderate, it was irresponsible. Apple is allegedly a premium brand -- and yet they offer not only a product with quality control issues, but just-fell-off-the-back-of-a-truck customer service.Original Review: Just had the second motherboard replacement -- and this laptop is not even a year old! Also had one power cord replacement, one track pad replacement, USB port replacement...you name it, it's blown. 'Genius' (sic) techs also screwed up my data recovery -- all but the most recent hour had been backed up, but I needed it -- we tried to attached the external disk drive before they sent it in, but somehow they crossed a couple of wires and fried everything. I had to pay an outside company, recommended by the Geniuses, to do data recovery. Said company explained it was not unusual for the Geniuses to screw up in this way.Searching the web, I see a lot of people have similar/identical problems with this model.Obviously, I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.However, if you want to take the risk, here are a few observations:I sent for the 13.3-inch, which in retrospect is a little tight. I probably would have sized up.I'm not crazy about the OS. It's not nearly as intuitive as they claim. And as for all the fancy finger swipes -- I just gave up and attached a mouse.(I have been a Mac desktop user for well more than 20 years, and a sporadic Mac laptop user. Right now I'm typing this on a five year old Gateway -- it ain't a Mac...but then Macs aren't Macs anymore, either.)"

I am a resident of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago and a customer of amazon for some time now. I have never had any problems with anything from the company but on the 29th of August I ordered a Mac-book Pro 13 inch Computer, it was to be delivered on the 4th of September. According to the tracking number it was delivered to the address that I use in the US for this purpose. On the 26th of September, after trying a number of avenues, I contacted Amazon telling them of my problem, so as to get some advice on how to track it down.I was incredibly but pleasantly surprised when I was offered a refund or replacement, where I come from this would never happen for an Item of this value.I did take a replacement and was willing to pay for expedited shipping when I was told that the company would do this for me at no extra cost, I am happy to say I received my mac-Book on the 1st Of October. I  am forever grateful to this company since a mac-book of this type costs approximately $12000.00 Trinidad and Tobago dollars and I have been saving for this for some time now.  I would like to say that Amazon has a customer for life since in reality it was no fault of their own the item went missing. Thank you Amazon and your wonderful staff( I think they all deserve a pay raise ;).Now on to the Mac-Book, while I never had a laptop PC before, I have had the use of quite a few, I am a practical person but if form can match function I would be satisfied. The Mac-Book is an amazing piece of hardware engineering, its beautiful to look at and exudes class, the screen is amazingly clear and crisp and the trackpad is heavenly to use. While there can be more USB ports, I suppose as a laptop there wouldn't be too many accessories attached since it may as well be a desktop. Another problem is that with extended use it becomes hot not overly so but it is quite noticeable. I am yet to fully explore the operating system and the programs on the computer but from the use that I did have, it is quite user friendly and  has exceeded my expectations.The one problem I do have is that there are some windows programs that have been the mainstay of the tasks that I usually have to perform. On the other hand the windows OS can be installed on the machine thereby giving the best of both worlds. Maybe a little later on I would update this review but for now I am a quite satisfied Customer.(PS: Up to the time of Writing this review I have not heard a thing about the first machine i ordered even though it was signed for by someone named La Fuente)"

The Macbook was defective and kept restarting itself so I couldn't even use the product. Proof that Apple products aren't as amazing as they're hyped up to be.So naturally, I tried returning it to Amazon but I had moved locations after I bought the Macbook, so UPS kept REPEATEDLY coming to the wrong address to try and pick it up. The customer service was TERRIBLE as I tried returning it before the 30-day policy, but they kept telling me to do different things each time so it got delayed to THREE MONTHS. I had FINALLY managed to get the Macbook shipped to the Amazon location but they actually SHIPPED IT BACK TO ME BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT IT WAS THE WRONG ITEM. So now I have to wait until I go back to that address and call them to come pick it up then.The best part of course is because it's being returned back after the 30-day return policy due to Amazon's incompetent customer service of handling A SIMPLE PICK UP AND RETURN, I am only being refunded 80% of the amount - meaning I lose $300. For buying a damn defective Macbook.Moral of the story? Don't buy expensive things from Amazon. If you're buying an Apple product, just do it the safe way and buy it directly from Apple and save yourself the hassle. Who knows how Apple will try to rip you off."

Second let me say not really.I hate it so much I wouldn't even give it to you if I hated you.First I wiped this device and installed a clean version. Then I updated. You know the low cost updates Apple puts out. Seriously I had to leave it running overnight on the update.It has been nothing but problems. Every update breaks something and not I am not kidding. Mostly they break their own tools or apps.I updated the software on a clean install, then update iTunes, cool yeah. Wrong.  iTunes needs quicktime version blah blah error starts popping up. Only that version is installed and I'm not using iTunes.Then I update the OS to the newest version only to see its killed Cisco VPN permanently. I don't mean the client I mean it removed the parameters in networking to allow connections. And it broke the web version of Cisco Anyconnect which you have to buy and its not cheap. My Apple support friends at Boeing have asked me how I fixed it. I look on websites forApple and they are dumber than crowbars so I happen to see a 64 bit mentioned and I decide to search for a Cisco 64 bit client and install it. Works again only I am running 32bit OSX nice. Then I try to update again to the best yet from Apple low and behold I'm told to buy it from the store. Only I have to have the newer version to download from the store. Apple intellect at its best.After a phone call and some money I have a cd on the way.  I install the next version, setup a printer, setup office, configure email, and install a couple other items nothing major though.Installed updates 1GB worth and bam the printer is dead. Of course on windows you can delete, or change/view the network settings, and reinstall in a minute. On a mac you need another 1.5 GB install. The cool thing is how you download the installer and it expands it and moves the files to various other locations. Sheer genius to take a download file, extract it to a .pkg file, then scatter files all over the hard drive so you cant possibly just go back to the download location to reinstall.  Now I suppose their is some script I could run but I can't even find the install using Apple guidelines from the OS. Not even using the help from from forums.Anyone that says a mac is easy is lying. Every update you run the prospect of losing hardware settings, programs you bought may no longer work, and you might even have a paper weight.The issues I have had are not hardware problems. I installed another harddrive, installed Windows XP and no issues, wiped it and installed windows 7 and both were faster and more stable.If all your going to do is browse the web and use iTunes you might be okay other than that they are junk. I have built a non standard Windows 2008 server on a Dell desktop and had to hack network card drivers and it runs fine, wiped a virus off a kids pc, did a complete reinstall of Vista without drivers on an older pc and spent less time than on this mac. I have had it two months and its been used about 12 times,  I have ins talled windows XP\windows 3.1\95\95\windows 7 and updated thousands of times and even the worst pc I have had, has never given me this much grief. This is the reason MS sold 60 million copies of XP, over 60 million copies of Windows 7 and Apple has sold 3 million mountain lion operating systems. And Apple charges $15 and Windows charges between $100-$300 per copy.If you buy a new computer every 3-6 months Apple is for you. The first couple updates will render it a paper weight and then you can get a new one and they will give you an $8 trade in credit too! As for the folks at the store helping you I would say yes they will if you forgot how to plug it in. If it involves tech support you better hope you have some good diagnostic skills. I usedto think I did before I got this mac.I got this laptop for troubleshooting and to become familiar so I could assist others. It has taken more research than my degree and let me tell you it certainly has help me learn how to troubleshoot macs.Now I know why few vendors make software for macs. It's not because Mac doesn't license them its because of poor/incomplete development at Apple."

Initially, I loved my 13' Macbook Pro and vowed never to go back to PCs. With my new 15' Macbook Pro, I still won't go back to PCs and in general I really like my Mac, but I no longer love it. I have the new 2012 edition with 750 MB hard drive and 8 GB of RAM. It's quite fast but doesn't seem any where near as fast as it should be based on its rated speed. RAM should not be an issue with 8 GB but it regularly runs out and I have to use 3rd party software to free up RAM, whether I'm editing photos in iPhoto or Aperture or running Final Cut Pro X. It seems that Apple should by now have figured out how to cycle RAM in a way that constantly frees up older allocations and keeps space open for applications being used currently. Seriously.Most egregiously, I'm really pissed off with how computer makers consistently lie about battery life. The 2012 MacBook, as with the few generations before it, advertises a 7 or so hour life under normal use. I find this unconscionably off the mark. My Macs have NEVER lasted more than three hours on one charge under even light usage (Word, web, etc.), and generally last about 2 hours new. This is so far from seven hours I don't know how it's legal to advertise seven hours.Conclusion: I like my Mac (and I really like my Mac desktop), but I expect a lot more from Apple nowadays. Three stars out of five. And I'd appreciate any tips (beyond the obvious) for increasing battery life or managing RAM.Update 10/6: I forgot to add that it gets REALLY hot, to the point where I can't hold it on my lap. This is far hotter than any previous MacBook or Air that I have had has gotten. Even the palmrest gets really hot. This is a major defect that I can't believe Apple allowed.Update 10/20: I've changed this review to two stars because this new allegedly lightning fast MacBook is simply not fast. In fact, it's pretty damn slow and gets hung a lot. It's also started crashing entirely, which has never happened in any of my prior Macs. Crashed twice today in editing with FCP X and I had to force re-boot with the power key. Really disappointed in this purchase."

The ones before it worked flawlessly.  I thought I was 'upgrading' to this machine but I was WRONG.  Boy was I wrong.  The changes that came along with Mountain Lion are downright horrific to the point that I'm ready to throw this thing against the wall.  I am SO frustrated with this messy, imprecise, unpredictable user experience!  So what sucks about it?--Now when you scroll on a webpage more than two or three times, the page will begin scrolling EXTREMELY fast causing you to lose your place and have to backtrack to try and find it.  Scroll a couple more times and it happens AGAIN.  This is f'ing maddening.  What's even more maddening is that this has been forced upon us with no option to turn it off!  I've called Applecare about it multiple times now and I'm told it's a 'design feature.'  WELL IT SUCKS!  Supposedly it's to mimic how an iPhone works?  I don't know, as I don't own an iPhone--but I do know one thing!  I DON'T WANT MY LAPTOP ACTING LIKE A F'ING IPHONE!!!--Rubber-banding effect on webpages.  This is where the webpage (or folder, etc) will stretch beyond its boundaries and then 'snap back.'  Now this wouldn't be a big deal if the rubber-banding only occurred on the tops and bottoms of webpages, but Apple has also decided to implement it on the SIDES of webpages.  This causes webpages to slip and slide all over the f'ing place, making it extremely annoying when trying to read text while scrolling!  Again, no way to turn this 'design feature' off!--Apple has also decided to change all the trackpad gestures, and not for the better.  AGAIN!!!!  No ability to revert them back to what they were in Snow Leopard.  Seriously--how hard would it be for Apple to simple offer an option to use the older, more familiar settings for these sorts of things?  I did manage to set my frontward/backward webpage settings to three-finger swipe like I'm accustomed to from SL.  Cool!  Ummm, too bad it barely works!  Half the time the trackpad is completely unresponsive when using this gesture.  How.  F'ing.  Obnoxious.I am racking my brain trying to figure out a way to get RID of this thing and go back to an older MBP running Snow Leopard (which was NEVER broken so I'm not sure why Apple went and tried to fix it!)  Unfortunately if I return it, I'll be slapped with hefty a restocking fee.  And I don't have the conscience to pawn this hunk of junk off on someone else.  I have never in my life regretted an 'upgrade' like I have with this purchase.  I have learned the hard way: Newer does NOT always mean better!!!  If I wanted a frustrating user experience I would have simply purchased a $279 Toshiba running Windows!!!  I will not rest until I get rid of this computer or Apple fixes their annoying 'design features' which do nothing but infuriate me and many others!"

Though you are getting an excellent machine and paying a decent price for the parts, many other machines can match if not go far past this one in terms of graphics preformance and other factors and run you a lot less.

I was having a though time deciding between the 13' MacBook Air or the MacBook Pro 13' (Both baseline models, priced at 1,200 $ retail) I went for the MacBook pro because I needed lots of storage and 128gb on the MacBook Air are just not enough for me and even if I had bought the MacBook Air it would had defeated the purpose of the Air since it wouldn't be so 'portable' if I had to take an external Hard drive everywhere with me.  So... Pros and Cons:Pros:Speed: This MacBook pro is fast, really fast, it boots up in around 30 seconds, apps open quickly and the MacBook doesn't lag when it comes to video editing, and Photoshop also runs decently. Design: The computer has a great design, its not that thick, it has all the necessary ports, even a battery indicator which I think is awesome, it also has USB 3 which is really nice and fastKeyboard: The keyboard is amazing, the keys are sensitive and it feels amazing to type on them, the keyboard is backlit, which is perfect for typing in low lights situations.Trackpad: The glass trackpad is really nice, its big, the entire trackpad is a button and the gestures are really nice. Simply the best trackpad I've used.Battery: Battery life is pretty good, I get around 5-6 hours doing normal tasks.OS X: This is my first mac and I'm impressed by OS X Mountain Lion, it comes with no 3th party software, it comes with all the apps you need + the Mac App Store is great for finding new apps. The OS is fast and fluid, everything is organized and it's just beautiful. I'm coming from Windows 7 and the switch was quite easy for me.Cons:Screen: I think 1280-by-800 is quite low for a computer this expensive and that its claimed to be a professional notebook, even the 13' MacBook air has a better display. Don't get me wrong, the display is not that bad looking, in fact its quite good, but for something this expensive it will be nice if it came with a better screen.Overall this is a great computer, its fast, has a great design, big storage (Even though it's a bit slow, but I'm planning on upgrading to a SSD soon) and awesome battery life. I will recommend this MacBook to anyone looking for a good portable notebook.One more thing, Windows users don't let OS X stop you from switching, the first days it's a bit hard to get used to it but after you will love Mountain Lion, and if you need any specific windows application that wont run in OS X there's plenty of ways of getting Windows 7 in a Macintosh"

First off, I would say that 75-85% of the Mac's on my campus are Pro's, rather than the Air version.Why?Weight isn't as big of an issue as they make it out to be.Performance is much much better on the Pro, especially if you install an SSD on it. (150$ish)The BadI would rate the mac as a 4 star simply because not all the software I need is available to Mac's. Purchasing Parellels to run Windows fixes the problem, but that's just another added cost to the already high price. Also, it is a pain to sync up a Droid phone because Mountain Lion isn't compatible with the Droid software yet.The GoodThe good news is the resale value is so high. You can spend $1,300 on a mac, and 3 years later still get 700+. A windows version will set you back $800 or so, and constantly have to be updated, and the value after 3 years will be 300$ if your lucky. This means a great deal to me as a college student, because I want something that will last a few years, but one that will also have a high resale value. Apple software in general is much easier to use than Windows also, so it is more user friendly.All in all, I highly recommend Mac's to college students.

The laptop is very lightweight and portable; I rarely even notice it's in my backpack! The keys are very well lit and comfortable to type on and you don't hear the annoying click-clack that most keyboards make (a plus for someone like me who enjoys the quiet). The sound is nice and loud; I don't have any problems with hearing anything. One of my favorite things about it is that you can't hear it running. I've had this laptop for only a week now but I've had it running pretty hard with all apps open and it'll just get hot, but you can't hear the fan or computer running. This is perfect for when I'm in class taking notes because I don't get distracted or annoy others by the computer being loud and disruptive. I only have two complaints: 1) the laptop heats up pretty fast but it doesn't burn your leg or anything and 2) the battery indicator is very indecisive, meaning that the 'Calculated Time Remaining...' isn't too accurate and it'll show only 4 hours left after I've completed a full charge and have my keyboard lights off and my screen at half brightness. Despite the battery life indicator, the laptop (at half screen brightness and half or less keyboard brightness) gets well over 8 hours of battery life, as advertised by Apple, which is PERFECT for me. I don't think a Mac is worth the $1000 but I do not regret spending it on this laptop one bit! Thank you, Apple, for creating a computer I can actually deal with!"

As for the laptop, this is our 3rd Apple computer in the past 2 years. Prior to that we were die hard Dell / PC fans. After getting sick and tired off all the blue screens, the (what seemed like daily) updates, and the OS lock ups, we decided to give the Mac world a chance. While we have been faced with some limitations regarding software (getting better daily), the problems that are persistent with a Windows PC are all but gone. The huge accolad I can give to Apple is; they just plan work...period. With this laptop in particular, to review it, will take some time as it is pretty fresh out of the box (so far so good though).

The power adapter is much improved and teh backlit keyboard is a nice touch as well.  The only caveat and this goes for all Mac users who may be upgrading and like to make the occasional iMovie.  Apple no longer includes iDVD with the computer and furthermore, Apple doesn't even offer it anymore!  I know Apple believes that DVD and, for that matter, Blu-Ray are dead.  But not offering a media burning solution and leaving us to (gasp!) a third-party solution which we all know don't always work so well.

The macbook pro is really responsive. If you've used an iPhone (or any touch screen device) you can use a mac's track pad no problem. I used to hate using track pads on PC's because they were always so small, I don't mind using the mac's track pad but would consider buying the magic mouse just because I'd rather use a mouse and the glass touch pad makes me nervous, I'm halfway afraid I'll break it. At the apple store I had the guy change the track pad so you don't have to click it, I can just tap it to open an app.The graphics are pretty good for someone who doesn't game a lot, if you're used to a lower end PC's graphics you'll be impressed by these graphics, although before I bought the mac I had a netbook and I was impressed by it's graphics too. If you haven't played with a mac in person, be sure to check one out somewhere if graphics are your tipping point. The screen is really nice, very clear and bright. The mac installed Microsoft office for mac with no problems. The only thing I would say that I don't like about the mac is that you cannot download more than one app at a time and it takes forever to download apps. I had to install Mountain Lion and it took a good two hours. I've noticed that if you close your open windows the app download time is less. The mac does get hot when it's charging, and when it's not it's still pretty hot (and I mean hot not warm.) Be sure to have good air flow where ever you put it. I have a fan blowing toward mine and it's been cool all morning even with the charger in. If you're going to let a little one play with it make sure you set it on a desk so it doesn't heat up your baby's lap. I've read that the mac becomes cooler as it gets more broken in, but I have no proof of that yet. I would recommend to a friend if they can afford it, if not an iPad or an iPod touch really isn't too far off. Also if you're a netbook user like I was the macbook will seem kind of heavy, but I'm sure after carrying it to and from your destinations (school, work) it will seem lighter.  One more thing, this mac does NOT come with restore disks and I am not sure if you can make them direct from the mac like you can with newer PC's, also the charging cables are made of the same cheap material as the iPhone/iPod touch cables. In my experience with the iPhone, the charging cable became very frayed and I could see the wires and aluminum in the cord. WIth a seven hour battery life I would recommend keeping the charger in one spot at home and making sure your battery is full before you leave home, or buy a second cable for use at work or school. Maybe that will save the life of the cord and keep it from being frayed from too much movement. This mac does come with an extender cable and I'm using mine right now hoping the cable will stay nice for the many years I plan on using this mac. The part where the charger connects to a mac is a magnet and a strong one at that, be sure to keep your credit cards and cell phones away from it so it doesn't erase the data. I did read that in the fine print of the mac booklet. I might have read it incorrectly, but better safe than sorry right?Hope this helps!P.S. the camera DOES NOT look hot it does on TV! It's very pixely, I don't know if you can change the quality of the camera, BUT just a heads up. It may be because the room I use it in has poor lighting, but it could also be that the camera just isn't that good. What you see on TV is probably pre-recorded using a real camera. I didn't buy the mac for it's camera or FaceTime or any of that so it's not a deal breaker for me, but it could be for someone else."

The uptdate worked perfectly and easily I had no problums downloading or installing it it took a tad bit longer to update then my fairly new 27 in iMac but was still quick for a whole operating system. The next step for me is to install the 1141 songs and three movies I own on iTunes. For that much I was suprised how quick it went. It downloaded them all in about a hour or so while dowloding other apps lisining to internet radio seting up email ect. I have setteld into it know and it is working very well. I use it to do the average persone may do and maybe a bit more. I love the backlit keybord and suprisingly doesnt drain the battery that much and remains around apples 7 or so hours. If this is your second mac you will be suprised with how much power it has just like me it runs probibly faster than my imac (also mountain lion).

It Did Get Better ~ But Really, Not Worth the Price","So where do I begin so that the legions of Apple critics and fans do not view this as support of their narrow views? I will say that I am not into the Windows vs. OSX argument - I do not think Apple is evil nor that they have, hands downs, the best products. I have had Windows desktops and one laptop - and yes - I had the typical problems with them that are often used as reasons for one jumping ship to Apple.I had said that my next notebook would be an Apple, but never really wanted to pay Apple's steep price. OPEN BOX is the way to go - I got 10% off a returned MacBook that looks to have never been used - the power cords had not even been unwrapped. Then - as a student and an educator - I was able to get another $100 off the price. Still, at nearly a grand after taxes, the cost was pretty steep when BB had PCs with similar or better specs for half the price.So, why stick with this? I want to find out for myself if this is worth the price and the hype.  I already knew that Apple's customer service is great, and that alone is worth maybe $150. I do very little on my comp - read the news, write some papers, watch a movie, play chess at Yahoo!, so I do not need it to be a power machine, I simply need it to work. And it does, very well, in fact. Processes are seamless -There is great integration of things like the email client, the Apple store, and iTunes - of which I have NEVER been a fan. I avoid iTunes on my iPhone at all cost - I use Media Monkey instead - But I can see how valuable it is on the notebook. I love how even the websites  and files can be viewed in cover flow.  Apple thinks of 'little' but important things like using a charger that is magnetically help in place, so that if you trip on the wire, it disconnects, instead of sending your expensive computer crashing to the floor.  And the fact that I can dual boot was a big selling point, if only so that I do not have to spend $100 to get Microsoft Word, which I will need once I start school again in a few weeks.I have had my MacBook for exactly two weeks, and  I do enjoy it when I can use it, but I have not yet decided if I will keep it. This is because the thing gets so unbearably hot, that it becomes too uncomfortable to use. My first day with this, I set it up, started playing chess through the included app -I was not even online - and within ten minutes, I thought the machine would burn a hole in my pants! I turned it off and ran to my desktop to do some research. And wow - what did I find!Yeah - yeah - I get that Apple says the MacBook should not be used on laps- I get that I should go into Activity Monitor and quit programs that have high CPU - which are NONE - as I am doing very little on the thing in the first place. Yeah - I get that all of the Apple fans out there have this way and that way - some of it costing extra money - to try to help make my computing experience on the MB a more enjoyable one. But this is an experience I should have right out of the box! What other company makes a computer at this price that you cannot use for ten minutes without fearing you will suffer a burn? Now, before the fans come out and say, 'Take it back, yours is defective,' I will remind you that this problem has been documented all over the Internet. I do not want to hear I should update to Mountain Lion. I have already done the research, and  some are complaining that their MacBook is running even hotter after the update. A co-worker of mine told me that he had a student bring a MacBook to him that had a battery so swollen that the chassis had separated by about 4 inches. Then I thought back to my own iPhone, which had to be replaced in January because of the same expanding battery issue; it split my phone's casing right down the back!How Apple sells these products (with consistent-enough overheating and battery problems) and gets the accolades they do is beyond me. Maybe it is because, other than these very serious flaws, they pioneer very good and exciting technology. You have the fans who will accept any ole shortcoming to remain loyal to what they think is a superior product. Then perhaps there are others who are in my situation, who for the most part really enjoy this MacBook and would love to spend more time learning and using it, but who experience discomfort in just trying to use it for basic computer tasks. This puts me on the fence, as I try to find solutions that do not require my having to dip into my pocket any more to use a computer that simply should not run this hot, especially at this price! If you do not mind the heat and/or are dedicated to spending more money to cool the MacBook, I say go for it.  Even if you are not, but you have been thinking of taking the Apple plunge, I say try the MacBook out for yourself so that you can come to your own conclusion about the overall quality and worthiness of  the MacBook.  As for me, I remain hopeful and very disappointed at the same time.  I soon have to make a decision about returning it, but I have to admit that I really like this machine so much now that the cost bothers me less and less everyday, but that heat... that is a whole different story!UPDATE -10/29/12After taking the comp in and meeting with the folks at Apple, the heating problem has simply resolved itself.  As someone on the Apple forums suggested it would, it just stopped heating up so much and so quickly.  For two months I have used the Mac - and for the most part have liked it.  However, it certainly is not worth this much money, not my money!  The novelty and mystique of the great Mac Book has worn off!There is just too much clicking I have to do to for basic functions like  minimizing a screen and finding files.  What takes 1 click on a Windows computer takes 2 on the Mac Book, what takes 2 on a Windows machine takes 3 on the Mac Book.  Sorry, but it DOES crash, and it crashes as much as any Windows machine I have ever used.  I do not like being forced to use iTunes.  If I had known beforehand that I could not download and use Media Monkey on this, I would not have bought this laptop.  I should be able to decide on the media management software that I want to use.  iTunes is not even very intuitive; rip a CD that is a compilation, and iTunes will not even rip it as ONE CD, rather as a different CD per different artist, and then you have to go in and correct all of the tags so iTunes can properly catalogue your music in its library, and then you have to tell the program to go back and find album art?  Who has time for this? Freeware is a whole lot easier and enjoyable to use, and allows you to use MY music the way I want to!  The Mac Book has stopped being fun for me, and I do not see what it has/does so much more/better than a PC to justify paying twice the price for half the specs of a Windows machine.I have not yet decided if I will sell it; this will be determined by how much I end up paying for a Windows laptop.  With Black Friday coming up, I should be able to get a good price, but if I end up paying more than $500, I will sell the Mac Book.  Never thought I would say that I am looking forward to buying a Windows machine, but Windows 8 is very enticing, at the moment.  The very good thing is that Apple products have great resale value, and my machine is only a few months old and is great cosmetic condition, as well as I have the latest Windows suite installed on it, so I should get a good price for it, if I do sell it."

They make the computer so much easier to use compared to other computers and the operating system is very good. i still love the windows operating system but the operating system for this computer is just amazing. The only issue i have with this computer is the price of it but it is worth it especially if you need something that is good for school."

Let me start off by saying that I was highly reluctant to spend so much money on a laptop. I've always been a Windows guy so I've known that you can buy laptops with equivalent specs to Macs for a good deal cheaper. Though after comparing different laptops I was not able to find one that had  a satisfactory build quality. The closest I could find were laptops made by Asus, but even then I read of too many build quality issues that made me uneasy. Ultrabooks made by other companies had good quality, but by then they cost just as much as the MacBook but with lower specs.  So I decided to take the plunge with this MacBook after demoing it in a Apple Store. Here are the things that made me confident with my purchase:Build Quality - Seriously, you can't beat a unibody construction. While other laptops creak when you pick them up due to the various plastic components screwed together, the Macbook feels firm. The only thing that initially concerned me was that the lid would slightly creak when you closed it. Running waxed dental floss through the hinges solved this.Trackpad and Keyboard- This extra large trackpad is heavenly to use. Having the whole trackpad function as a giant button is a lot more comfortable to use. Plus two finger clicking as a replacement for the right click button is surprisingly intuitive. The keyboard keys are well spaced and the led backlighting is very cool.Power System - I regularly get around 6 hours from the battery, which I am more than satisfied with. The magsafe plugin system is more handy than I thought it would be, and there is a neat led battery indicator on the side of the notebook that makes checking the battery level with the computer off easy.OS X - Mine initially came with Lion, but after upgrading to Mountain Lion I am even more satisfied. Everything runs fast and animations are fluid. I love the multi touch features, which again is something I initially didn't think I would really need. It took me a little time to get used to using finder after being accustomed to windows explorer, but I am confident now in my ability to navigate through files just as quickly as in Windows.Dual Booting - I have a few engineering programs that only run on Windows so I decided to install Windows 7 through bootcamp.  Because it boots natively from the hard drive, it runs just as smoothly as any other Windows laptop. Remember folks, this computer doesn't have any magical internal components. The Intel Chipset is the same used in any other laptop and thus Windows runs just the same with the proper drivers installed.Chipset - The Intel Core i5 runs very fast with minimal heat. The Intel Graphics 4000 is more than adequate for most applications.I could even run Portal 2 on maximum graphics settings and play 1080p video without it breaking a sweat. The fan almost never revs up to an audible level. This is in part to the aluminum body being a giant heat sink. So yes, the laptop body can get warm at times. But it is never uncomfortably warm when I use it on my lap. Ill probably upgrade the RAM and the harddrive to an SSD in the future, but for now they are fine.So all in all I am very happy with my purchase. I am officially a Mac convert and will use this laptop for a very long time.Also, all the Windows 'gamers' who are trashing Macs need to gain some perspective. Yes, I can get a Core i7 laptop with a dedicated graphics card for a lot cheaper than the MacBook. But I decided to spend the extra money to get a better engineered laptop with some nifty extra features."

That should make this computer worthy of 5 stars.The ssd and extra ram are an option if you order directly from apple, but your definitely going to pay for it.  I think it was around 16 hundred bucks last I checked.  (It never hurts to check your options).If you ask me for almost $1200.00 an ssd and at least 8gb ram should have been included, but whatever, everybody wants more $$$.Overall I'm happy, but I'll definitely be happier when I upgrade to the ssd and more ram.  It's a solid laptop, and the aluminum body at least makes you feel like you've got something for your money as opposed to a plastic shell.  And I don't feel like I'm going to snap it in half on accident like the macbook air.I'm also thinking of taking out the optical drive while I'm putting in the new ssd.  I watched some video's it's not rocket science so if your comfortable with electronics you shouldn't have a problem.  This should make it a little lighter, but may void your warrenty (but not forever apparently).  If you need to get it serviced the guys at apple just told me to pop back in the optical drive before I get it serviced.  They definitely have good customer service, so that is always a plus.They said changing the ssd and ram doesn't affect the warranty at all so if your sketchy about removing the optical drive you can at least upgrade to the ssd and upgrade the ram and not affect your warranty.  Hope this helps if you have been looking at macs for a while like I was.  Read other reviews, but more importantly actually visit an apple store and play with the different laptops if you can.  That will help you decide more than anything.  Good luck!"

(not too sure whether I am allowed to do post the same review but just thought it could help some people before they switch to OS X)I have been a Windows user since I started using a computer and I never used a Mac OS X till I actually bought the MBP in 2011. So, this review would really help someone who is considering a Mac for the first time and wants to use it either at school or to remotely connect to work. This article summarizes what you would love and what you could be missing.I previously owned a desktop, a HP laptop and a Compaq laptop before I bought a MBP. Also, I still use Windows machine at work. One of the major reasons I bought the MBP was because it was available on a eBay deal from Macmall for $950. I assumed that if I did not like it, I could always sell it for at least $850 on eBay or Craigslist.Before reading the next part, please do understand that MBP and OS X come together. Things you need to know --**OS XSwitching between applications - This is one of my biggest quirks with OS X. Windows 7 does an awesome job in switching between applications. When you want to switch between the applications, you use ALT+TAB in Windows 7 and this would shift the focus to the next application. If the application is minimized in OS X, you can switch between applications by using CMD+TAB but it does not automatically bring up the other application, it just changes the active application in menu bar. I never understood the reasoning behind this, why would I just want to see the menu bar of the other application, I cannot imagine doing anything just with a menu bar.After some search on the internet I found the work around to do this in OS X. The answer is to press CMD+TAB followed by the option key (just before releasing the CMD key) to switch between the applications perfectly. You can also scroll your four fingers on the track pad to bring up all the applications and then highlight the application you want to choose to change the active application window. It is simply irritating to switch between keyboard and the track pad when you are typing some document or email. You can also use function key F11 instead of swiping the four fingers on the trackpad but at the end of the day Windows 7 does a great job here.Please do note that you can only switch directly between applications but not directly to the active window of an application when you use CMD+TAB, for example you cannot switch directly to a open second excel workbook, you have to bring up the excel application first and only then can you switch to the second excel workbook. I am aware that there is software available (namely Witch for $14) to do this but I already paid for the machine and why should I go through all this trouble and change the system registry entries to simply switch between applications.We can also use spaces and assign some shortcuts to spaces(like option+arrow) to make the switch between applications easier but you need to assign a different space to every application and this could be tedious after some time. Also the animations could make you dizzy after a while (not too sure whether everyone would share the same opinion) and there is no way you can turn off these animations AFAIK.Switching within an application - To switch between the various windows of the same application, the answer is to press CMD+~, it works but what if I have 3 open excel workbooks. Same answer as above, scroll the four fingers or press the function key F11 to see all active windows.Taskbar could be a big deal - It is irritating not to have a task bar in OS X. You can never actually know that you had two open excel workbooks or two separate browser windows at a glance. To put this into context, try working in Windows 7 grouping all your applications together all the time, in Windows 7 the users have the option to ungroup individual windows by selecting 'Combine only when taskbar is full' in the taskbar properties. The problem with this approach in OS X is that you will never know all the application windows unless you display all the active windows or highlight the application in the docking bar.Also, the docking bar still occupies a substantial amount of screen space even in its minimal size , in Windows 7 the taskbar is comparively small. Due to the screen size and resolution constraints we usually tend to hide this docking bar on the 13' MBP so that we can see the applications in the maximum available screen space. So either compromise on seeing the active applications in docking bar or full screen mode for applications.Again, the app Witch is the answer for taskbar but it will display these active windows only when we press CMD+TAB.Full Screen - I am addicted to seeing everything in maximized window mode in Windows 7 machines, I could never be satisfied with the default resized small windows, so I installed a free application RightZoom to address this issue. So far, so good.Quick Links - The docking bar essentially acts likes the quick link shortcuts in Windows 7. CMD+W closes the application and CMD+Q quits the application, you have to be careful enough not to press Q instead of W. Please note that closing a window does not automatically quit an application, the application is still active and consumes CPU resources.VPN Connection - Certain (or many?) VPN connection softwares like Juniper cannot be installed on OS X because some of these VPN connections connect using some plugins that are designed specifically for Internet Explorer, which is not available on OS X. I wanted to connect to work using the Microsoft Office remote desktop client but could not do it due to this restriction .External Applications - All the applications cannot be installed in OS X. There are lots of companies out there that make products just for Windows machines. I had to install StatTools for my course work and the tool was not available for OS X, so I had to work from another Windows machine at work on the weekends for my course work. I could have also installed Bootcamp and that comes up next.Bootcamp - I installed Windows 7 using bootcamp on MBP. I observed that Windows 7 is slow and the hard disk makes squeaky noises when you are trying to open an application in bootcamp, also the track pad experience is not the same despite the various drivers and the keyboard layout is obviously different. You can overcome these problems by connecting the MBP to a HDTV or any monitor and then using a wireless Windows keyboard + mouse but then the whole setup is too much hassle and defeats the purpose of a laptop.Microsoft Office - The experience of using Microsoft Office on OS X is pretty subpar in comparison to Windows 7, may be it the fault of Microsoft but it is simply pretty hard for someone to transition from Office 2010 in Windows 7 to Office 2011 in OS X. For example, I am used to zooming in and out of Microsoft Word using shortcuts like Ctrl+Scroll Up (on trackpad) and Ctrl+Scroll Down but this option is not available as shortcut in the OS X version of Office. I wanted to type a formula for a cell in Excel and cannot find the formula bar. May be someone can help me if they know a way around enhancing this experience.Delete button - There is no substitute to Shift+Delete in OS X(CMD+del). Deletion followed by emptying trash is the only way to do it, if you are someone who is addicted to deleting the file at once there is no shortcut. CMD+SHIFT+DELETE is a shortcut to empty trash after you delete something (so two steps, not a major gripe).Cut + Paste - There is no such option as 'Cut+Paste' in OS X. If you want to move something to a different folder, you have to copy and paste the file into the target folder and then delete the original from the source folder. Or select the file and carefully drag the file from the source into the target folder.Preview - Preview can be used to view PDF files and image files. Preview can also be used to make some markings in a PDF file, that is pretty cool. But what if I want to see all the pictures in a folder at once using preview, the only option is to select all the images and then right click to open with preview to see the files (In certain situations we can select all images and press space bar and the photos come in a stream slideshow. Also, every time you open a PDF or an image file the preview application becomes active, I would have preferred the application to quit automatically when I close the image). In summary, it is easier and cooler in Windows 7 to view images.Software Installation - There is no control panel in OS X. Just drag the application into the trash bin and it is gone. It has traces in your system but essentially it is gone for all practical purposes. I like this easy deletion aspect in OS X.Wakeup time - The MBP is pretty fast on this aspectMountain Lion - Mountain Lion will provide you the option to wirelessely stream the content from your MBP to HDTV if you own a Apple TV (I do not know the other improvements, this stood out for me), something similar to the WiDi on the Windows laptops. Thats a really cool option, you do not need to have any HDMI cables at all to stream content.**HARDWARETrack pad - This is something you would love to use and a big selling point, you can never think of going back to other laptops after using this. I always used a mouse on the Windows laptops but never even felt the need for a mouse on the MBP. The two finger swipe to scroll and three finger swipe that replace the 'Home' and 'End' buttons, pinch and zoom for PDF document and images are pretty cool options. I was pretty amazed at the track pad when I started learning more about the OS X.Keyboard - Keys are located spaciously. My previous two laptops frequently had dirt stuck in between the keys which used to drive me crazy.Heat - HP and Compaq laptops generate so much heat that you can use them as a personal heater (I used to do it). The whirring sound made by my Compaq laptop's heat fan used to be pretty embarrassing for me in my class or in the meetings, I hated opening the laptop. In a contrast, the MBP is very calm, the fan does go up occasionally when you run some intensive applications such as office (along with some other intensive applications) or play graphic video games but you will hardly notice it.Build - Unibody aluminum build with just 10 screws at the back is something you would appreciate only when you have used other laptops made of plastic material that make creaky sounds every time you lift them. The upper lid of these other plastic material laptops tend to wobble a lot over time but the MBP's lid is pretty stiff even after 7 months of daily use (at least 3 hours a day).Screen - I personally like the fact there is no slight gap between the glossy screen and border of the lid. In other laptops dust gets stuck between the screen and the plastic and it could be really irritating when you cannot remove the dust. Screen quality, there are different manufacturers for the LCD screen, please search for 9CC3, 9CC5 and 9CC7 to know more about this. I have a 9CC3 (luckily) and it is supposed to be the best one available for a 13' MBP.Ports - HDMI port is not available directly but you can buy a 10 feet long HDMI output cable for less than $20.DVD Drive - Other laptops tend to have DVD drive as an attachment but in a MBP it is inseparable (at least by the looks of it). The DVD drives on the two other laptops I owned before MBP used to make a quirky sound when I used to wake them up from sleep or do a restart, no such sounds on the MBP.Battery - The longest battery life out I could extract from MBP was about 6 hours with browsing. That is pretty good considering that other cheaper laptops can only last for 2.5 hours. Of course you can upgrade your battery on the other laptops but you need to compromise on the weight.Power Chord and Charger - One of my friends accidentally tripped over a $1000 Sony Vaio's power chord and the machine fell on the floor with brute force. I still remember how anxious he was till the machine powered up. This would not happen with a MBP, the chord attaches to the MBP with magnet, in case of an accident the power chord would detach itself and nothing would still happen to the MBP. The adapter is light weight and you can carry it in a backpack (no big bundles like the ones you see for HP and Dell).Function Keys - I use the function keys in Windows 7 machines to close application, essentially which means that I am going to just use F4 for pressing Ctrl+F4 or Alt+F4. I like the Apple's way of function keys, pretty easy to use and only contains what we exactly need. Ctrl+F4 and Alt+F4 are replaced by CMD+W in OS X.Webcam - 720p & perfect for Skype.Backlit Keyboard - If you have not used one without a backlit keyboard before you will love this option.Resale Value - Based on the eBay listings I can say that you could expect to recover 75% of the actual value of a MBP if you maintain it well (if sold within a year of purchase).Apple Warranty - International warranty for 1 year + easy replacement within 3 months + Apple protection for 3 years for $200 (warranty is international again) is really worth it. I felt that my battery was losing its power quickly and Apple Store promptly replaced the battery for me.Cons (the only one)Speakers Sound - Sound is kind of low for me, I really wish that it was louder.So to summarize I am impressed with the hardware by every bit and I really do not have any complaints about the hardware design.******************************************************************************In conclusion, if you are going to use your laptop for Microsoft Office and want to connect to Windows machine through Remote Desktop or VPN, I would recommend not to jump the ship to OS X and instead consider other alternatives listed below. The experience of Microsoft Office, switching between applications and productivity is much better on Windows 7.I would still recommend a MBP if you want to buy a laptop for casual browsing and simple applications at home, the hardware design is pretty awesome and Apple support is trustworthy.Alternatives to consider - Similar hardware design with Windows 7 would be a very good combination and that brings me to Windows Ultrabooks. Ultrabooks are about the same price (or in some cases cheaper than MBP), faster with a SSD and are very appealing with Windows 8 soon on the cards. I read on tech websites that HP Envy Spectre 14, Lenovo U300S, Asus Zenbook, HP Folio 13, Dell XPS and Samsung Series 9 are pretty well built like a MBP but run on Windows 7. Samsung Series 9 looks pretty good and has a 15' option as well, so thats some good news if you are a Windows fan."

The new MacBook 2.3ghz - 15.4' is fine as laptop computers go. I don't need the 'Retina' model and would never buy one. My display is almost too bright and sharp as it is. The display is beautiful even without 'Retina'. The MacBook Pro Retina display models also eliminate the DL-DVD player/burner, the Ethernet connection and the FW800 port. All three are options I use almost every day!! Why would I pay more for less!!Of course, the 500 Gig 5400 disc is too slow for music production and 4 Gigs of RAM had to be updated to 8 gigs of RAM. Apple, really!! You couldn't give consumers another $35.00 of RAM, which would have provided the 8 gigs instead of 4 gigs? This is really petty on the part of Apple. A high performance computer should come with extra RAM when it's so inexpensive. At least I can replace the Hard Drive and RAM, which you can't do with the 'Retina' MacBook Pro.My real complaint is with Amazons bate & switch game. You go to buy a computer and Amazon is listing that laptop for almost full price. So, they show you others that are a little less expensive. Which one will you buy? You'll buy the cheapest one available when they're the same (brand new) MacBook Pro computer. Once I made my purchase for $1789.00 for the MacBook Pro, Amazon lowered their price down to $1709.00 for the exact same computer. When I called Amazon about getting a price guarantee, the call center representative said, 'Sorry, you didn't buy your computer from Amazon, and regardless, Amazon has NEVER had a price guarantee.' Well I'm sorry, I did buy my computer from Amazon, with an Amazon credit card. The transaction was done on the Amazon website, with an Amazon vendor. Every consumer based store in America has a price guarantee for at least 30 days from the time of purchase, but not Amazon!!I hope it's worth it to Amazon that they've lost a customer for life and thousands of dollars of purchases over the next few years because of their petty business practices. I recommend that no one buy their computers from Amazon, because they will not give you a 'Price Guarantee', once they change the price the next day.Nice one Amazon!!!"

My first experience with a Mac has shown nothing but technical incompetence. Their automated phone support system doesn't work and took me half of an hour to get a person who then told me he couldn't help me because that was a different department. They gave a $100 gift card with the Mac which didn't work (even though at Coffee Bean, Starbucks, etc. I've NEVER had issues with gift cards). Now the laptop itself dies after one week.  I'm forced to deal with this company because I teach programming, but it's beyond me how this company has grown to the size it has.  The laptop is twice as expensive as an equivalent Windows laptop and three times as expensive as an equivalent linux laptop.How does this company stay in business? Especially a tech company that can't its tech right!  I love and use linux. I use Windows and it works. So far all I've seen from Apple is terrible support people and a terrible product."

Granted The Mac Book Pro looks cool and trendy. But once I got to practical day to day use, I started feeling frustrated with it. Here are my findings after 4 months of intensive use. I am a software programmer who runs multiple virtual machines at the same time and use my computers at their peak.1. Mac OS Lion is a bloated piece of software. It takes more than 5 minutes to reboot the system. And it takes as much orsome times more to shutdown the system. Sometimes it even refuses to shutdown. It seems something is going on with iTunesand AppStore that prevents it from shutting down. My only recourse was to hard reset through power off and on.I had to reboot many times because the Mac Book Pro's performance degraded with time.2. The heat dissipating shell is a real bad idea for a high performance laptop. I have to rest my lower end of palms on thelaptop for typing. There is no other way unless one is stationary and set with external mouse and keyboard.Since it gets so hot in that area, my wrists started getting hot and I felt pain in the arms. I had to wear mitts to insulate my palms from the heat.3. Wireless connectivity. While my HP laptop was able to quickly connect and stay online, the Mac Book Pro took too longto connect and frequently dropped the connection."
"865","XX","B0074703CM","5.0","12","16","June 23, 2012","A2JZFIHP1Z3988","Great computer practically any every-day use","I purchased this Macbook about a week ago, and I have to say that I'm genuinely satisfied. I come from the high-end Windows laptop user base; my previous laptop was a Dell XPS. I thought the transition would be difficult at best and would take some time to fully familiarize myself with the new Mac ecosystem. If you are considering switching from a Windows computer, do it. I have no regrets. OS X is simply amazing, and while there is a learning curve if you're coming from another OS, it's easy as pie to understand. Everything just works on a Mac. WIth the exception of some games- but with Boot Camp you can install Windows on any Mac.  And this MacBook looks as good as it performs. Simple details, crafted aluminium and real glass make this laptop blow away the other plastic ridden, bulky sticker filled laptops. This computer exceeds my expectations in almost every category.My only issues with the laptop are as follows:1) It looks beautiful. Yes, that's a good thing, but it's made from aluminum that scratches easily. You're better off buying a case alongside the purchase of your mac. A keyboard cover also wouldn't hurt. A scratch on a $1,500 MacBook is unforgivable.2) There is no HDMI port. This is an issue for me, as I frequently connect my computer to my television. But there is a simple solution; purchase a mini-displayport to HDMI adapter.3) The sound on this laptop is severely lacking. On my previous XPS (and other mid-range laptops) sound really wasn't an issue. But with this laptop, the bass is very weak and the sound comes out sounding tinny. My solution to this was to purchase Boom by Global Delight ([...]). Boom is a software application that adds sort of system wide equalizer to the Mac, thus affecting all outgoing sounds. It's a good fix, in my opinion. I have it set up to bass boost all the time, and the music comes out sounding decent, if not SLIGHTLY tinny (MUCH less tinny than before).So there you have it. And if price is a concern, you're really paying for build quality. I've never seen any other laptop at this quality for much cheaper."
"866","XX","B0074703CM","5.0","314","363","June 22, 2012","A3T19VAFDDSFIW","Simply the best computer I've ever used... with one possibly irrelevant issue","I used to be a die hard windows fan. I was always bashing OSx for the usual things (too expensive, too dumb, et cetera, et cetera), and I never really gave it a chance. Windows 7 was my OS of choice from the day it came out, and I used it on many different computers with (or at least what I thought then) good results. It's certainly not a bad OS but...This past holiday season, I got an Asus tablet PC. I wanted to love it, I really did. I gave it a five star review here on Amazon, and I tried my very hardest to use it to it's fullest potential. It was working fine for a while, until I tried the Windows 8 beta. It was all down-hill from there. Viruses, problems (beyond those that should be in a beta, and a general ugliness drove me absolutely insane, and I decided to move away from Windows, at least temporarily. I bought a Chromebook, and while I absolutely love it and highly recommend it, I wanted more out a computer than it offered.So, nearly on a whim, I bought a Mac. I have never made a better tech decision. Literally everything about it is better than any computer I've ever used, from the operating system to the hardware.People typically say that the real reason they love Macs and other Apple products is because of the build quality. While the build quality on this computer is INSANELY good (I feel bad hauling it around with me; I feel like it should be in an art museum), I really think it's the software that makes this a standout computer and computing experience. I've had absolutely zero backround in OSx up until now, and already I am easily finding my way around this computer. Granted, I've had a good backround in Linux and OSx is similar, but the fact that I'm easily navigating a brand new operating system after only one day is quite the contrast from Windows, now that I can look at it objectively. OSx Lion is wonderful. The multi-touch gestures and the multi-touch mouse itself are immensely helpful, and it's because of features like these that make it clear to me that it's almost necessary for a company to make the hardware for a product if they're making the software as well. Everything works extremely well together.Like I said, the included apps put Windows to shame. With the exception of Outlook (which I personally hate, but my Mom has a Mac and can't stand the contacts App and uses Outlook), I can't think of a single, rational person who would pick Windows software over Apple software when it comes to things like media, photo/video editing, and email. To be perfectly honest, it's ridiculous how well all this stuff works. I downloaded the iWorks office suite (which is not free, though significantly cheaper than Microsoft Office), and they also work like a charm. I really don't create a whole lot of spreadsheets or slide shows so I can't guarantee a qualified opinion on Numbers (Excel) or Keynote (PowerPoint), but the Pages app is lightyears ahead of Microsoft Word. I also downloaded Logic Pro 9 (an music synthesizer/recording studio app) after having used it with friends a few months back, and have spent hours digging into another fantastic piece of Mac Software, and I can say for a fact that it is truly unparalleled in the Windows world.The actual hardware internals of the computer are amazing. The new Ivy Bridge processors whip through anything I can throw at them, and the 8 gb of fast (1600 mhz) ram makes multi-tasking a breeze. The nVidia graphics card, while not a show-stopper, is completely adequate for some heavy-duty video editing in something like Final Cut or Photo Shop (though I haven't used Photo Shop in about a year now, so I'm not COMPLETELY sure about the latter of the two statements), or gaming (whether you dual-boot or pick one of the games from the increasingly impressive OSx catalogue). The speakers, while not mind-blowing, are much better than what I'm used to from integrated laptop speakers, and the screen, even though I opted for the non-HD screen, is very good; colors are bright and saturated, the pixel density is more than satisfactory, and the viewing angles are some of the best I've ever seen. Battery life is as good as advertised, and the computer starts and runs much more quickly than I'm used to, especially considering that this computer doesn't have flash storage.I haven't run into a single thing I would change about this computer up to this point. I love the software, I love the hardware, and I love my decision. If you're in the market for an exceptional, powerful notebook, look no further. I can't recommend this computer highly enough.Edit: While the great things that I mentioned about OSx are all still completely viable and even after several weeks (months, perhaps?) of heavy usage I haven't experienced any problems. Mountain Lion is a great update and even though I don't own an iPhone or an iPad (I'm more of an android guy), I still like almost all of the additions it brings to OSx.However, I have since installed Windows. Bootcamp is a marvelous program, and in about 20 minutes I had Windows 7 working great on my computer. All the drivers were installed and performance was great. Once I actually started playing games though, several design flaw were suddenly extremely apparent to me, and they were apparent in a very bad way.I'm not sure if Windows is just a more demanding operating system or if a fan driver was left out of my Bootcamp install, but the cooling of this computer when doing ANYTHING intensive under Windows is absolutely atrocious. The unibody design is gorgeous. It's revolutionary, it's stylish, it's classy, and it has major practical issues. The vents are hidden under the hinges of the screen, and anything but the most perfect of screen angles will block off much of the fans output. Even with the fans blowing full blast at nearly all times while running Windows, the computer gets extremely hot during usage. I use a laptop as a literal 'lap' top computer frequently. This works fine under OSx; it's impossible under Windows. The bottom of the computer gets painfully hot during heavy usage (to the point where I literally can't touch it for more than a few seconds), and the metal area (ironically) around the 'wasd' keys gets extremely hot as well. I've had the computer completely overheat three times only in the past two weeks. Since I only play online games, this isn't a real issue, but I can't imagine what would happen were someone actually doing something important on a Windows partition and have the computer overheat and shut down. Even with good ventilation (meaning smooth granite surfaces and a laptop stand specifically designed to enhance ventilation), there is no avoiding an extremely hot computer and constantly whirring fans.Long story short, I'm very glad they improved the fan design in the Retina Display Macbooks, because it is, frankly, very, very poor here.I'm conflicted on whether I should change my overall rating of the computer though. Even though Macs are equipped (through Bootcamp) to run Windows, they weren't designed to do so, and I certainly haven't had a single issue while running (the far superior) OSx. Considering the fact that I should be basing my opinion of the product on its own merits and not on those of a competing product, I don't think I will change my overall scoring. I do think it is prudent to add, however, that cooling while running Windows 7 is terrible. If you NEED Windows, stick with a Windows computer. They will most likely handle Windows better than this one will."

The laptop been a great educational tool (better then the iPads) and I can recommend it over any other Windows laptop. I am splitting this review into two parts, the laptop and the operating system.Laptop:The laptop is expensive; but you should consider it because of the stability and dependancy. The laptop is extremely quiet; even while I am typing this review I can hardly hear the fans going. Someone I know recently got a Dell laptop and the fans were so loud that it practically vibrated off the counter. Also, it hardly ever crashes. I did encounter a glitch that caused it to shut down without notice when I first started using it, but a month has passed and I have not seen it happen again. Along with the amazing durability is incredible speed. My Toshiba laptop will take three minutes to fully boot up and another five minutes to launch Chrome or Word. It's not an old laptop either; I received it roughly two years ago to replace my broken netbook. In comparison, Macbook Pro takes at most 30 seconds to boot and most applications will open instantly or within 10 seconds (with the exception of the Adobe software). The battery life is average, it will last almost 7.5 hours on normal settings. The graphics card supports split-screen (something my Dell could never do) and is able to render models with high-polygon count. It's a high-priced but worthy laptop.The operating system:What really kills Windows is the Mountain Lion OS, which is on the Macbook Pro by default. The UI (user interface) can be customized in almost every way; from repositioning the dock to changing the color of the menus. The 'multiple desktop' function allows you create more than one desktop, allowing you to spread programs out. A simple swipe across the trackpad and you can switch between desktops easily. Applications are easily found by activating Launchpad, an iPad style grid. The UI is simple enough for most people to learn and includes a lot of bells and whistles for those who want full potential. Keyboard shortcuts are another handy thing that Windows lacks a lot of, by entering a key combination you can access Spotlight (Mac's version of the Windows start button), empty the trash, create new folders, even hide applications! Mountain Lion also offers voice recognition, by entering a key combination (FN x2 by default) the Siri mic will appear and you can speak whatever you want to be typed. Windows 7 has something like this,but  all I remember it doing was asking 'What was that?'. Along with easily access to these features you get various functions that Windows does not have. Airdrop is a mode that allows you to send to anybody on the LAN (Local Area Network). It has came in handy multiple times when I am in class and need to send a file to somebody. Dashboard is a special screen that has things like a translator, calculator, and sticky notes on it for easy access.Overall, Macbook is something you must get. Macbook can dual-boot both Windows 7 and Mountain Lion, so you can have both on one laptop if you must. The durability of the laptop will make it worth the money."

Theres about few major differences from the upgrade that I noticed.First the fan noise. I light whisper. My old device had no sound at all, but suffered from heat issues watching flash videos, then when stressed more the fan would get very loud. However this new model (which may be similar to the i5 series CPU) runs cool and more constant. I suspect its fan is different it idles at 2000rpm.The CPU,  the difference isn't always apparent but does perform well so far and is noticeable watching videos. Ill need to play with it more before i can really say more. Originally I had interest in a MacBook air but didn't want to get an even weaker device than the base series pro,  since apples products are underpowered to begin with and I recall the AIR isn't user upgradable (unless I'm wrong?) I felt this model was best. And I could most likely upgrade ram to 16gb (still have to confirm this is possible on this release)Lastly battery sustains itself ever so slightly better. My older device battery health hardly deteriorated (4%) and this guy seems to cruise smoothly without significant drain."
