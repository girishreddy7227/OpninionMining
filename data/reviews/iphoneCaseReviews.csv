I disagree with reviews that case is too slippery in hand.  I also disagree with reviews that contend this is an otterbox killer.  It is notably thinner than an otterbox defender and not as thoroughly protective, with only a beveled edge to protect the front screen and a thin back cover.  The best protection is on the corners.  However this case is more aesthetically pleasing than any otterbox case.  The gold color matches the phone perfectly.  The gold portion accumulates slight scratches but it does not excessively detract from overall appearance.  The tactile feedback from the power buttons and volume controls is very good.  Some reviewers may wish to know the cutout at the bottom of the phone is large enough to accomodate the Apple lightning-to-30-pin connector cable for those that need to connect to 30-pin stereo docks, old chargers, car stereos, etc.  I have dropped the phone in the case from waist height onto hardwood and it did not sustain any apparent damage.  Nonetheless, 4 stars because I still have some trepidation about the case protecting against hard falls or heavy wear-and-tear.  Balancing the numerous pros and minor cons, I would buy this case again."

My husband works at the hospital so really likes that he can clean his case every day with a Clorox wipe when he comes home and it doesn't damage the case or make it old looking.

I go through 5-10 cases with each phone and this is by far the best one I've ever had, for any phone.Please know that the silicone/rubber part of the case is hard. Almost as hard as the plastic back.

It is a little more 'stiff' than other similar cases, but the material is still pliable. It's very easy to install.  I do wish that the product packaging was a little more eco-friendly (It's packaged in a large hard plastic case - Should've been in some kind of small cardboard sleeve or something).One thing to note - Some other reviews have said that the side bumper materials are not 'rubbery' like they had hoped. Well, the sides are definitely not made of rubber and are not 'soft', but they are coated in that kind of rubberized plastic so it gives a good grip in your hand and on the surfaces so it doesn't slide around.  So it's not any kind of slick material or anything, but it's also not 'gummy', it's somewhere in-between.Overall a great case that I highly recommend."

On the whole, I like this case very very much. The back plate (slate in my case) is hard plastic, I wasn't sure when I bought it if it was supposed to be plastic or aluminum, probably I just didn't read thoroughly enough. The other, primary piece of the case is a softer plastic, it is in no way something I would call rubber though, but still flexes enough that I feel like it will be an acceptable shock absorber. The case also looks really slick.My gripe is with the gap for the headphone jack. To get pretty much any 1/8' audio connecter into that jack, requires jamming it in hard enough to cause the plastic of the case to bow out slightly. So in the end it works, especially since I have to jam the cord into the jack really hard without the case on (that makes me nervous, Apple), but I'm not wild about it. I think the plastic is flexible enough to hold up to this kind of use/abuse, but time will tell."

I only gave it 4 stars because of this. id give it a 5 if it were perfect and hard all around.The edges over the top and side are very nice and firm and that i love.I was also disappointed that it did not come with a screen protector. i read a few reviews that some users got screen and home button protectors. incipio and otter always include them. its cheap and i think it would be a nice thing to do"

The case is sizable enough that it feels sturdy when I put my phone down on a table, and yet it is still small enough to fit into my front pocket in my jeans.Any smaller, and then it is too much compromise on the protection.Any larger, and then it won't fit into a pocket nicely.The power and volume button covers feel sturdy, too.  It takes a little more effort to hit the power button which, as it turns out, is actually a nice advantage here - no more accidental power-ons when I go to pick up my phone.I assume the case will show signs of wear over time, but that is to be expected.The case does provide a bit of a lip on the front, so that you can put your phone down on its face and the glass does not touch the table.

In fact, this is the most 'robust' phone case I've ever used, but I have to tell you, I am much impressed.  In fact, I dig this thing, totally.I use my phone when I cycle, and this case is what I should have always been using.  It offers very nice protection, but it's not ridiculously HUGE.  And the other big thing is the built in 'buttons'.  The tactile quality of these make it easy for me to adjust volume while the phone is riding along in my jersey pocket.  And while I thought the size would bother me, I find it to be just fine.  It does make the phone 'bulkier', but if I'm in an office environment or wearing business attire and I want it to be a little sleeker (which is rare), it's quick to remove.  I like that, because there are times when it's nice to admire the phone for the nice design and finish, and perhaps I'm in a professional environment where a more subtle appearance and size is preferable.  It's too risky to leave a case off for me (hiking, running, cycling, grandkids) so I'm finding this case is the best for my needs; I used to select something that was a compromise when it came to true protection (other than scratches and mild nocking around).  Again, I have to say, the size doesn't bother me because it's so well designed; the edges are just right, the finish is grippy where it should be, smooth the same.  I've ribbed my friends for years about their gigantic Otter Box cases, and this little dumplin' catches there attention like right now!I did have to shave the rubber from around the jack on my Shure headphones so they would fit, but it didn't harm them a bit, and it allows me to use this case!  Just not a big deal to me; no compromise at all.  Couple of minutes with a sharp blade, and it was done.I have the black Iphone 5, and I bought the white/black model of this, and it gets a LOT of comments.  The finish seems quite durable and so far shows no signs of wear after about 2 months of daily use.I've always been very impressed with Spigen's products, but I have to say, this is my favorite one.  So far, anyhow."

I have dropped my iPhone at least 20 times and never a problem.  I needed to replace it with something more sophisticated for my new job.  I wanted something that was classy, and protected my iPhone from my butter fingers, but didn't add extra bulk.  I was really surprised that this case is exactly the same thickness as my Speck case was.  It looks and feels very solid and well made.  I can tell it will hold up well to abuse.  It adds surprisingly little bulk to the phone for the protection it provides.  And it looks classy, even sophisticated. I like the dark blue a lot.  The buttons are very easy to push, the bottom lets through the sound, and the lightning connector has a lot of space next to it.Two things I don't like about it probably won't bother most buyers.  I don't like cases that put a hole to reveal the Apple logo.  I like the iPhone as a tool, I don't want to be perceived as a fanboy! The hole makes the design look kind of clunky and awkward, and mars the nice lines of the case.  I may have to put a sticker on on the logo to get rid of that. Secondly, I use an Apple 30 pin to lightning adapter on my bedside dock, and the case won't fit that.  However, most cases won't fit that, it might be an unreasonable request.Added 11/21/13: As others have mentioned the colored plastic back of the case is susceptible to scratches.  I saw noticeable scratches within a week of use.  It mars the otherwise fine design of this case. There should be some kind of scratch resistant coating on it."

This case does just that! I haven't dropped my phone and I hope I never will, so as of right now I can't attest for the drop protection, but from the feel of it I believe it would do a wonderful job. The only downside I could probably tell people is that there isn't a protective screen for the Apple logo. Not at all a deal breaker, but it would be nice. I just bought some cheap screen protectors and that did the trick. I never did like Otterbox's because of their bulky-ness (is that a word?)

(Doesn't show any delay, either.) In a world of a vast number of quality iPhone cases, obviously this is not the manufacturer to purchase one from.---Update: My order went unprocessed because (1) the item changed from 'Ships from and Sold by Spigen' to 'Sold by Spigen Fulfilled by Amazon,' and (2) the other part of my order 'SPIGEN iPhone 5S Case Slim **NEW Release** [Ultra Fit A]' was removed on Amazon -- page no longer exists.I did finally receive both cases, and while I am displeased with the Tough Armor's $3.79 price drop that occurred in the interim, I am pleased by its quality.  As far as design, the urBeats fit into the headphone jack, no problem.  I haven't tried using Apple's Lightning to 30-pin adapter with it, but that is why I bought the other Spigen case (although, BEWARE: That model appears in photos to have a black cutout around the flash, and it does not. The cutout is white).So, while the Tough Armor product is good (better than Otterbox's Commuter case, in my opinion), I wish I could say the same about the company between its price fluctuations on Amazon (which differ vastly from its site), and its not only changing the fulfillment but also removing a product from the site midstream, along with misrepresenting the design in photos.NOTE: The Steinheil Ultra Crystal Screen Protector offered at 50% off with this purchase is a good deal.

I've heard all about the OtterBox, and have seen the OtterBox in use by several friends.  OtterBoxes I've seen are a bit bulkier than most iPhone cases, but with their advertisement of protection from drops and what-nots to the iPhone, I can accept their bulkiness.Then comes Spigen's Tough Armor.  They advertise drop protection, along w/ a slim fit case, which makes the total size of the phone 1.4x bigger [than the standalone iPhone], vs OtterBoxe's 2.1x.  Not only that, but Spigen also touts their Spider Web Pattern TPU, which supposedly allows better air circulation (dissipating heat).  Prior to purchasing this case (I had my phone naked for several days), it would get warm to touch (but of course, all of my phones have done so), while watching video, or playing games.  In similar situations, the case seems to absorb, and dissipate the heat, as I have not felt it get as warm.Tough Armour also advertises their air cushion technology in the corners, allowing the case to absorb more impact from a fall.  Thankfully, I have yet to drop my phone, but I have high hopes in the air cushion absorbing powers.The buttons are nice, and doesn't seem to require more pressure in order to depress.Overall, I've been very pleased w/ my case, and truly have no regrets regarding my purchase.  Hopefully they will continue to make outstanding products.Oh yeah, and a nice bonus, for those who truly care about your iPhone status - there is a cutout in the back (as shown in the picture), which allows all to see that you are in the elite iPhone coterie."

Overall, I'm not giving it 5 stars primarily because of the scratches on the metal back plate to the case that show up pretty easily from everyday use and even on inserting and removing from the leather case I bought. Other than the scuffs, this is a great little case. I'm generally a bit clutzy with my phone so I do tend to drop it on any number of surfaces. It has hit concrete, blacktop, desks, chairs, gym floors, and a few other surfaces, with nary a scratch on the phone itself. It's thin enough that it fits great inside a suit jacket packet or pocket of any pants. I don't use a screen protector and never have. I always just look for a case with a lip high enough to provide protection. This does that job well. The camera lens cut-out works great and never seems to impede the dual flash on my iPhone 5s.

I paid half price for the Spigen case due to a very short term special price.The Spigen case is very slightly better than the Acase but it's close to a tossup.  I would still get the Spigen case for $12 but I would get the Acase instead for $8 if the Spigen case were at its current $24 price.

Tanky cases such as the otterbox defender is nice and durable but it leaves you somewhat wanting to use your phone less. It pretty much makes it a hassle. Then if your somewhat OCD as me (paying $20-$40 for a case and not expecting quality), it can be annoying buying cases such as a TPU (techarmor/diztronic) case and having it stretch out over 2-5 months. I've been using the acase dual pro for a while until I saw this.Yes this case is a 2 part but the black part DOES NOT stretch out which I find to be amazing.

I'm a bit leery of the protection claims... the rubber/plastic inner layer seems like it could be slightly thicker; I'm not however, doing to purposely drop my phone to test it out.  It still feels/looks like it offers more protection than lesser cases.My issue is the hard backing that you snap on after putting on the softer case.  The backing looks classy and looks like metal, but it's very slippery.  I'm uneasy holding my phone in certain environments because the back of the case makes me think the phone is going to slip out of my hands, sometimes.  I wonder why someone would build a case that's suppose to offer protection, yet make the back of it so slippery that it increases your risk of actually dropping the phone (??); they need in my opinion, to add a slight texture to the hard backing for better grip.I'm sure they have other items in their line that would better suit my phone if I get around to researching it.

I have used a defender for years,  once on an old android,  again on my iphone 4, then again on my Iphone 5.  I wanted to try the tough armor because I wanted a thinner case AND I wanted to enjoy the screen.  You cannot do that with the defender.  The glare, and their protector takes away from the screen I feel.  This case is good.  I take care of it.  When it's in my pocket it's the only thing in my pocket.  I have taken notice, I GENTLY put it on a counter, and it has scratched the back.  ALOT.  other than that, thats the only issue.UPDATE:I ordered this case and have had it since about the start of September.  I take care of my phone.  The back of the case is scratched ALOT, to the point where it looks like whatever they use to make the case 'slate' is wearing.  It looks worn.Another issue which I just emailed SGP about, is it messes with the sleep button recently.  I have to press HARD to get the sleep/wake button to work.

The case fits the iPhone perfectly and adds a very sleek look to it while providing a substantial amount of protection. I love the way the buttons feel and the cut outs at the bottom are perfect. The case fits the phone nice and snug yet is still easy to remove if need be. All my friends that have seen the case have commented on how nice it looks and I wasn't even trying to show it off. The material the case is made of seems like it will last a long time and is very durable. I own about a dozen cases and this one by far is the best one, it looks great and I am very confident that if I drop my phone it will protect it. There is a nice lip around the screen for added protection to the screen. In the event the phone falls on a flat surface you can rest easy knowing your screen is safe. Since the lip around the screen causes the screen to be recessed Spigen provided home screen buttons along with the case. Overall I have no complaints about the case and plan to order another one!*UPDATE*Unfortunately my phone was knocked out of my hand and was popped up very high in the air and fell on concrete. However I am pleased to report that absolutely NO DAMAGE happened to the phone whatsoever!!!! The case got a few scratches and dings of course but when I removed the case to inspect the phone everything still looked good as new!!!! Great Job Spigen!!!!!!!!!!!!!"

The satin finish aluminum feels very much like the iPhone itself which might be viewed as a plus were it not for the fact that the black part is more akin to hard plastic than rubber or silicone.Summary: sharp edges and slipperiness aside it's a nice looking, well-constructed case."
"312","XX","B00DMKGPP4","4.0","3","5","August 10, 2013","AXPUE8QAU686C","Slim, clean look with smooth, well fitted, harder surface","I purchased this in white and it is very clean and crisp looking, just like my iPhone 5, which is a look I wanted to preserve..  The top and bottom ends are just a little more matte feeling than the body, which is smooth but not shiny.  This is not a rubberized texture, so it would likely slide on a dashboard--it has a harder feel, but seems well protected.  Some might like a more comfort grip in the hand -- and this is more firm than that, but it is not sharp-edged like the phone is without a cover.  I like how my pretty Apple mirror logo shows through the hole in the back.  This looks expensive and classy and is still very slim.  All the controls and openings are just fine with my iPhone 5.  What remains is how it will weather dirt, etc., which is always tricky with white.  After being disappointed with a Belkin rubberized white which turned gray within about 2 weeks, I will update on this.  For now at least, I would say that this case is clearly better quality and better-made than cheaper cases--and I am pleased with my purchase."

When I saw this on Amazon while searching through literally hundreds of cases, this one sang to me. I received my Spigen Tough Armor case today in the mail. Unexpectedly, the stick-on home buttons and screen protectors were a bonus. Well packaged and well received. Ship time was quick considering and excluding the known wait time of the advertised release date. Now to the case.Great job with keeping it slim. I have had Defender and Commuter cases alike, and this is wailing on them. The case is very nice in the hand, not overbearing, and keeps the iPhone slim like its supposed to be. The face is opened up like it's not in a case, yet the lip keeps a bumper extended far enough out to lay it on its face. The interchangeable plate on the back is a nice touch for added protection. Also, I immediately checked the piece that connects between the home button and battery charge (a known breaking point on iPhone cases), good job. Thick yet pliable to flex.I will not be test dropping this on purpose as I am not that dedicated to jack up my phone. I do trust that the air pocket design you have designed on the corners will work. Otterbox has a serious design flaw in their rubber 1st layer. My Commuter I WAS using was starting to expand. The battery and flap wouldn't stay closed, and drove me crazy. I would rather not have it, if it were going to fail. The internal crisscross design and material you have used will surely stand up under age. The buttons are flawless. Power, volume up and down work so well.I am the guy that spends hours researching, reading reviews, and watching videos before buying. Spigen, this is why I am writing a full evaluation. I am not a review writing person, I don't have time. However, I have made time to tell others, ditch the junk from Otterbox and check this sleek, sturdy, well-designed case out. Albeit this is brand new, and I promise if I have to eat my words I WILL be back and retract my previous assessment, I think I am going to be A-OK with this case.You have a new customer Spigen. I take my brand dedication very serious. I hope you take your customer service equally. I foresee many more coming to you."

It will replace my beloved Slim Armor by the same company. The Tough Armor has a less slippery feel than the Slim, has better access to the vibrate button and a lip around the faceplate to allow face down on the counter mode if you like that.

It follows the same design as the Slim Armor and Slim Armor S, but adds a hole for the Apple to shine through and extra TPU on the sides. There is also a large lip so you can set it face down on a table or something (or put on Spigen aluminum buttons and not have it 'Siri' when you set it down). Unlike the 'muh' look of the Otterboxy (see what I did there?) this one is sleek and provides decent protection. The buttons though (volume and pwr) are square and might need a small amount of more pressure to use; not a big concern.This is a great choice if you're looking for a tough-ish, modern looking case and not something with an ugly logo that's shaped like a box."

Fits perfect. I like the way the case fits the front of the phone perfectly.  It doesn't cover the screen at all but covers right up to the edge of it.  It covers the thin metal lip that surrounds the screen.This is 2 pieces and it does come apart, but I don't find I need to take it apart to put it on or take it off. The phone is easy to install and remove.The front lip they are touting for this product is nice reassurance that if i drop it face first it wont hit the screen.  Its hot as huge compared to some other brands but I think it'll work fine.  Because they way spigen makes their cases it doesn't really bug me to much when I have to use the edge of the screen.The openings on the bottom of the phone are nicely done. Speaker ports are wide open, charge port is large, headphone jack looks like its easy to access.  The camera/flash opening is nice and large, and you get an opening for the apple logo, sweet...Even the opening for the vibrate switch is easy to use.  The opening seams better than the first version of the slim armor case.Now the buttons look like they would be a pain in the ass.  This is not the case. I was surprised to find how responsive the buttons remained given the way this case looks.  Kudos to spigen design on these buttons. All though its not like having your phone w/o a case, the buttons on this case work way better than other 'box designs'.The volume buttons seam to maintain more of the click than the power button, but the power button is still very easy to press.Overall great case.  It does at a little bulk to your phone but way way less than others that they say they compete against.  The materials feel like top notch normal spigen quality."

Very same as far as I can tell.I read here that it scratches easily, so I've taken care with it to keep it looking nice. So far no scratches at all. Because there is a protective lip around the front of the phone I just lay it face down when I'm not using it. It stays completely unblemished.To be sure, you need to order a screen protector when you order this because it doesn't include one. With a screen protector you can lay it face down without any worries.My wife uses an Otterbox Commuter, and it's a lot thicker than this and looks very clunky in comparison."

However, I read one review on the acase that pointed me to this Spigen as being superior.So, I looked into it and got one of these.The closest thing to a complaint I have is that 'fatter' headphone plugs (usually with extention cables) don't fit while using this case.The acase's rubber coating was a bit 'stickier' than the Spigen so the Spigen comes out of my pocket a bit easier. Also, I like the Spigen's buttons better.Really, it's fantastic. If it holds up for two years like the acase, it'll be my favorite."

I loved my Ballistic cases and my Gumdrop as well, but the edge on the side of the phone is high enough that it trips me up when playing games or typing messages.  The edge of this case is low profile and that's a big seller for me.  Fits very well too for a 2 piece unit.

The case looks fantastic and doesn't add much bulk to the phone. It is a very similar color to the gold phone, almost exact.It fits the 5S very well. There is a small lip that curves around the phone edges, and it does a pretty good job of protecting the screen from minor falls.

I wanted something that did a good job of protecting the phone, and looked great. After putting the case on, I think it will definitely do the job. It is a bit bigger than I would like, but looks decent. Only reason for downgrading by one star is that its not as easy to take off and on in a pinch. My older cases were in two sections allowing you to slide the cases on or off very easily. This case is one unit with a removable back that keeps the case snug against the phone. But it also make it more difficult to remove the case easily. This is an issue for me because we have plenty of docking stations at home and this case needs to be removed to use those docking stations (a known issue).

The entire iPhone is a screen that can crack from the smallest falls.The Otterbox is the only other case I've had that kept my iPhone's screen intact throughout its whole lifespan, but I hated the size (even the more reasonably sized Commuter).  It was always a hassle to get it out of my pocket, god forbid I was wearing jeans.So I read that the Spigen provided comparable protection and decided to try it.This is a great case.  I bought the Spigen on October 2nd (today is December 5th) and my phone's screen is completely intact, despite numerous falls (even onto the street when I got out of my car). The volume buttons are incredibly easy to use and I can even plug in my auxiliary cord without having to take of the case, which is a big deal considering how often I use my iPhone to listen to music in my car.While it isn't waterproof and doesn't come with a screen cover, this case will protect your phone without making it annoying to handle.

The button areas are much easier to push than a lot of other heavy duty cases I've used.One of my free time activities is long distance cycling.  I put my phone in my one of my three jersey pockets.  While on a long ride I will often either be pulling stuff in or out of those pockets.  There's always that possibility of pulling out my iPhone by accident while removing something else.  If my phone should fall in that process, it needs to be able to withstand a fall.  This has happened to me.There were a few scratches on the case after hitting the pavement.

The Spigen website with videos were very helpful in narrowing down the many case choices. Decided on this case instead of the LifeProof case which I had with the 4S.

I had both an Otterbox Defender and an Otterbox Commuter on the 4 (I had it for 2.5 years.)  Good cases, and I liked the screen protection.  But now they seem like some Soviet Era field cases compared to the Spigen.  Sleek, stylish...easily slides into a pocket.  I've received numerous complements on the case and lots off iPhone friends who want the name of the company that makes it.THE GOOD: Sleek.  GREAT fitment, nice curved corners.  GREAT button functionality and placement.  Cover snaps together easily and tightly.  Sleep button -- which I had some problems with on my Otterbox -- is great.THE BAD:  Not really bad, because I knew what I was getting, but no screen cover.  Slipped a Zagg dry fit screen cover on it and it's well-protected now.BOTTOM LINE: Sleep, stylish case that feels great and looks good.  Great protection with minimal footprint...Great job, Spigen!"

With our last iPhones (we had otter boxes) they did the same so we are used to it. Charging is perfect with the case on it, just our sound box doesn't let us with the case on. The otter boxes always broke around the edges (the plastic part) these won't because it is sturdy rubber around them with air pockets inside of them for extra protection.We are very happy with them and we feel as safe as we can expect from a case, plus the design is so beautiful.I would recommend this case above all others"

I like the case because it is slimmer and I think more durable than some of the other cases (Otterbox, etc.) I've seen for the iPhone. There is a real slim lip that surrounds the front face of the iPhone so if you were to drop it on the face, the screen hopefully wouldn't crack. The softer inner portion of the case is probably not as &#34;cushy&#34; as some of the other cases, but I think it does a good job. The top screen button and side volume buttons are nice and sturdy.Overall, I am very satisfied with my purchase and I would recommend this case to anyone."

As designed, the case protected my phone from any damage at all. Not fractures in the glass anywhere! The phone with the case as well is very comfortable in my hand and while using the phone against my ear.My minor issue with the silver case is that the silver backing scratches very easily. Only after about 1 week of use I am seeing some noticeable scratching on it. But that does not change my mind on giving the product a 5 star!"

I've seen (and experienced) too many iPhones with smashed screens after being dropped.I also find the body of iPhones to be too slippery for my liking. They feel great initially, but the minute it slips out of your hand or slowly slides off your jeans when you set it on your leg, you'll wish for a slightly grippier surface.Finding a case that provides adequate protection (especially of the screen) while not defeating the slim and light design of the iPhone is hard. I've had good luck with the OtterBox Impact case (though all of their others are far too heavy, bulky and annoying to deal with). Unfortunately there isn't an Impact case out for the iPhone 5s yet.After searching for awhile, I was able to find a case that I thought was comparable. We ordered two of these Spigen cases hoping they would work well. I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived, and I find it much better than the Impact case. It is slim, light, has a lip on the front to protect the screen when dropped, provides just enough grip, and looks very handsome on the iPhone (both space grey and silver). The buttons all work perfectly, and align properly. They feel very responsive and clicky. It definitely feels very nice.My only gripe with the case is that, like most iPhone cases, it provides limited access to the headphone port. It works fine for the included EarPods and other slim headphone cables (Radio Shack sells cables that fit, that's where we went) -- but bulkier cables (like those found on high end headphones and many car aux input cables) don't fit. For this reason I give this case 4 stars instead of 5.Overall we are very happy with the design and quality of the cases."

One unexpected downside is that one pair of ear buds from Shure (I believe the se215 model) cannot plug into my phone when this case is on.

I like that it feels like it's got better protection than a standard clip-on or bezel protector, but isn't bulky like a standard Otter, etc.The button covers are the best I've used on a case. Overall, I think it's well designed and fits very well. I paired this with the matte finish skins from Best Skins Ever and I love the pairing! Some don't like the matte on the Retina because it tends to make micro coloring in whites, but I LOVE the application, anti-glare and fingerprint resistance vs. the gloss. They are my favorite protectors and have them on all my devices. I mention this in case you are considering BSE screen protection because - You DON'T have to get the &#34;case friendly&#34; protectors. The regular screen protectors (and back!) work perfectly fine with this case. I put the back one on to protect from grit in the open circle, etc. If you apply the edge pieces it will stretch the case out a tad. I actually have the one along the top of the phone and down the side because it protects near the exposed area by the mute switch. I wish that I could get the speaker skin to stay on, but I've tried TWO of them and both buckled. oh, well.I find this to be a simple, sleek, size-effective, cost-effective case for the 5s. If I want a different color, etc., later, I'll go back to the Tough Armor or other Spigen case. I've only had one drop -THANK GOODNESS -  from a table to tile about 2 feet with no issues.Will update in the future if any findings change!"

This case is a full TPU case with a indention on the back body of the case for the aluminum type backing. It seems like a insert that you can pop off, but once on the phone in, it is set and won't come off.  Where that backing meets the TPU on the side, it is not flush and you can feel a edge which may bother some people This case does add a noticeable amount of size to the phone compared to a snap back case but what you gain in size you also gain in protection.  I personally like the size of the case bc if gives you a better grip and more control of the case, but definitely not as big as an otterbox..  I also like that the camera cutout is just big enough to not get the flash white out bc I don't like the look of the really big camera cutout.

After watching a couple of drop test videos and having a friend who ordered the case, I decided to take the plunge and see how it was.Before the Spigen, I had an Otterbox Defender - best case on the market, in my opinion. However, I have never been a fan of how bulky the Defender is and decided to go in a slimmer direction. Also, I carry two iPhone 5's on a daily basis, so the competition for pocket space is strong.Aesthetics - I think the Spigen sweet looking case. To me, it has this tactical look to it, which I really like. I'm also a huge fan of the silver and black color combination; I think it compliments the phone well.Durability - Watch the drop test videos if you have any concerns about it's durability. The only knock I have against the the phone - lack of a screen protector. If if had a screen protector, I would have given it a five star rating.*Note: You can buy a glass screen protector for the phone, I believe it runs about $35.The thing I absolutely love about this case?? It's so thin! Obviously, compared to the Otterbox Defender, anything is considered thinner, but this case is really thin. I absolutely love how easily it slides in my pocket and how well it fits in my hand.One of my best Amazon purchases to date."

Spigen has struck the perfect balance between bulk and protection.The Tough Armor seems slightly smaller than the Otterbox Commuter, but it does not appear to provide any less protection. The buttons are wonderfully easy to press (something that Otterbox and others always failed to achieve); they provide a nice solid &#34;click&#34; without requiring much force. The mute/volume switch is very easy to access &#8211; even easier than Spigen's Slim Armor case. The cutouts at the bottom of the phone are large enough to accommodate my Belkin Lightning cable. The case has a nice soft finish so that the phone will not slip out of your hands easily (unlike Spigen's Slim Armor), but it does not get stuck in pockets or collect excessive lint. In fact, the case is simply a joy to touch. (It reminds me of my old &#34;Sharkskin&#34; controllers for my Playstation 1.)I have always been picky about my phone cases. I am the iPhone user who hates bulk; I think it's a shame that a beautiful piece of streamlined technology has to be hidden in a case twice the phone's size. I also hate cases that provide no protection for your investment. Spigen has struck an almost perfect balance.My only complaint would be that the case does add some weight to the phone. However, it is unrealistic to achieve this amount of protection without adding a little size and a little weight. Spigen's Tough Armor case has set the bar for maximum protection with minimal bulk."

It _DOES_ offer a smidge more rubber at the corners (and you'd need a micrometer to measure this in comparison to the Stealth), but that's about it for extra protection.  All ports remain exposed, although they did increase the Lightning opening so it now accommodates thicker 3rd party cables.  The small rubber buttons that you had on the Stealth are now replaced by large rectangular equivalents on the Tough.But that's really it for Tough.  It LOOKS tougher, but I can't really say it will BE any tougher than the Stealth.  And the plastic outer shell still suffers from the same scuffing that the Stealth shell did as well.  They really need to improve the coatings on these things.Apple cutout on the back is a nice touch, however."

This phone only goes in my pocket, alone and not with keys or anything else that could rub against it, and on my desk all day while I'm working, then on the nightstand while I sleep.  I don't know how the case could get scratched up so easy - it only touche smooth surfaces.Sure, I guess it does it's job in protecting the phone, but for $25, I want a case that looks decent too.  I can't imagine what this case would look like after a year.  Or even a few months from someone who does throw their phone around.I gave it 2 stars because it does have a nice firm fit and it feels like it would protect the phone from cracking if it was dropped.  Also, it looks nice for the first week or until the scratches start appearing.I guess I thought I was going to find a good alternative to the massive Otterbox Defender, but it looks like if you want 'Tough Armor' for your phone, you're going to have to dish out $35+.I'll upload some pics tomorrow."

It seems like it will protect my iPhone 5S in a fall, but I'm not going to test it either.  The reason I gave it 4 and not 5 stars is due to the way the case is designed around the headphone jack. You could easily plug in the headphones that were included with the phone, but any other AUX cable could not fit pass the case shell for a proper fit. In other words, the plug would only go in partially. So inorder for me to plug my phone into my car radio aux, i had to remove the case.

It is a great fit, and doesn't move around. I like that it is comparatively thin, so it doesn't make the phone too bulky.  A few things are a little more exposed than I would like them to be, however.1. The apple symbol on the back of the phone is exposed. It is somewhat hidden by the inset provided by the case, but it could still get a little scratched and scuffed.2. The rear camera inset is well shaped, and appears to provide fair protection. I doubt this could be better without making the case exclusively for the 5s.3. The volume buttons are covered, and I haven't noticed any problem with activating them.4. the vibrate switch is also well protected, about as much as one could expect. It is exposed, but protected as well as could be hoped. If you have very big fingers, it may be difficult to access the switch.5. The power switch on the top is covered, and also doesn't seem to have any problems with it being covered.6. The holes for the speakers, the charger, and the headphones are nicely protected, though they are exposed. Again, I think the protection is as good as could be hoped.7. The front. This is the only area where I have a &#34;problem&#34; with the case. There is no screen protection, so an additional screen protector would need to be purchased and installed. An all-in-one solution would be preferred.  The case does provide a beveled edge, so the screen isn't sitting on the surface if you set it face-down. But, any drops or scrapes that don't hit this edge are completely unprotected.For where it protects, this case does an excellent job without making the phone overly bulky. An additional screen protector is required, but the case appears to to a great job otherwise.The sleek look enhances, rather than detracts from, the overall appearance of the phone, unlike many other cases."

I couldn't fit it in any of my pockets. Though it offers amazing protection, there was too much sacrifice for 60$ this case is a third of the price, and is built with high quality materials and from my experience protects against all drops on its corners, back, and screen with the lip. I just recently cracked my phone by dropping my skate tool on the screen, as this case does not protect against that. So I would reccomend getting a glass screen protector so that if you drop something on the screen, than it could protect against all impacts. But, if you do not intend on dropping something directly on the unprotected screen, than buy this case. A great deal for its amazing small size and protection.

The phone arrived a week late and when contacted, they made excuses that it was coming from far away and they were not in full stock. While this is unfortunate, it is not my problem!

That one pretty much convinced me.Oh, I've had a number of otterbox cases in the past and this is MUCH thinner.  The is a hard, but flexible plastic case that slides in and out of pockets pretty easy.  All of the otterbox cases have that silicone rubber that stretches out after about 6 months and becomes useless.  I freakin hated that!"

I looked at the Defender for the 5S and since the revised versions were just being rolled out, they also have that initial premium price attached to them (basically more than double the price of the Tough Armor given the color combination that I wanted) which I know will come down to more realistic levels after a few months.  While Otterbox has every right to capitalize on the market when a new form factor/revisions occur, the pricing is becoming a huge turn off for what you're getting.Looking over the reviews and comparisons for the Tough Armor here and on YouTube, I decided why not since I wanted a case before I switched over from my 4S.  I decided on purchasing the White one since I thought it would match my Silver one the best (yes, it looks good).  The case has been a pleasant surprise since I've gotten used to the extra bulk of the Defender.  As of this writing, it's been a month since I've had the case and the white is pretty decent in terms of not showing any sort of scratches that some have  with the other colored cases.  As a matter of fact, the case I have has not picked up any scratches to date.The only reason I gave it 4 stars is the lack of a built-in protective window for the rear cutout for the Apple logo (yes, I know that one can apply a rear protector for the phone but it would've been a nice touch if the case had it built in.  Overall, I'm very satisfied with the product and would highly recommend this line to anyone."

Just wanted a little added protection without adding too much bulk.  In this aspect, the Spigen Tough Armor case excels.  It doesn't add too much bulk to the phone, keeps the look streamlined, and feels sturdy enough to protect the iPhone should I accidentally drop it from my hand.  Now, I don't think it offers the same level of protection as the Otterbox Defender does (as Spigen would like you to believe), especially for the screen, but that Otterbox is just too huge and cumbersome to use everyday.The Spigen case looks awesome too.  I got mine in Metal Slate, just to add a touch of color without being too obvious, and I've gotten a lot of compliments.  The buttons work perfectly, in fact the volume buttons are easier to use than without the case.  The lip around the screen is tall enough to prevent the screen from scratching if you place the phone screen down on any surface, but it does not look intrusive or add too much thickness to the phone.  The cutoff on the back for the camera/flash is large enough so that it will not mess with your pictures, and the logo cutoff adds some personality to the case.There's only one major drawback that some people may find unimportant, but it's a big deal for me.  I upgraded to the iPhone 5 from an iPhone 4 about a year ago.  Before upgrading, I had already bought several charging cables, docks, alarm clock, etc. to work with the iPhone 4.  In order to continue using these with the new lightning port on the iPhone 5, I bought the Apple Lightning to 30-Pin Adapter (original one from Apple).  The iPhone 5 looks funny in the docks, but at least I could continue using my old stuff, especially the alarm clock I use to charge my phone overnight.  However, because of the cutoffs on the bottom of the Spigen case, I can't use the adapter anymore, since it will not fully insert into the lightning port.  So I have to remove the case every night and replace it the next day.  Not much of a hassle, but I'm afraid the case will eventually break from installing and removing it so often.  On a positive note, all lightning cables, including the Amazon Basics one which is thicker than the original, fit perfectly.In short, if you don't have to worry about lightning to 30-pin adapters, this is probably the best case out there.  Stylish and protective without adding too much bulk.  Can't beat that!"

I also seem to be less klutzy and careful with my phone than I was when it was in a crazy thick Defender case. I appreciate how NOT sticky this case is due to the absence of the over-stretchy rubber of the Defender. It's  refreshing to access the power adapter and headphone ports without dealing the otterbox defender rubber flap that kept unlatching anyway. Granted, I haven't dropped my iPhone on a sidewalk or hard floor surface yet to &#34;truly&#34; test the Spiegen case, but I am not worried about my phone'a safety nonetheless. Also, I bought a Spiegen screen protector to complete the protection. Overall, I am quite satisfied with this less bulky case, and its rigid enough structure."

Her hair is fried, she doesn't know what she's talking about, and she uses a soda stream.  I mean, the soda stream isn't a bad thing, or rather, it wasn't until I saw her use one.  I may have even liked using a soda stream, but now I'm never going to be able to because it will remind me of her and she is a bloated mess of apologies and bad timing.

It had everything I was looking for in a case: a slim design, able to withstand a couple drops with no damage and covers for the volume and hold buttons.I was skeptical at first, I mean the case is comparatively cheap to Otterbox, Lifeproof, etc; but after watching a couple review and test videos on YouTube, I was convinced. I placed the order for a black Tough Armor case along with a GLAS.tR on SPIGEN's website (not Amazon) and within a couple of days my stuff was at the door.1) First ObservationsThe packaging for this product is very well done. I was expecting something a little less &#34;nice&#34; for this price range, but SPIGEN did a really good job. You can tell SPIGEN has an attention to detail, nice job. The case itself is very solid, it has two &#34;parts,&#34; a very strong black silicone/rubber-like material that is smooth to the tough and very hard but still slightly flexible to squeeze your case in and a second aluminum sheet that goes around the middle section of the case. This part appears to be anodized and has a matte finish. The buttons on the case have a very nice feel to them and are very large, so it appears to be easy to locate these buttons without looking at your phone.2) FitTo get the phone within the case, you need to first put in the left side with the volume buttons and silent switch, then you get the other side in. The case has a little flex to it, but this is a very snug fit. I have absolutely no reason to believe that this phone would fall out of the case. Visually, everything lines up perfectly. The silent switch (exposed) is perfectly in the center of the little &#34;hole&#34; that it is in and the speakers/lightning port and camera all line up perfectly. Even the apple logo in the back is centered perfectly. Overall, either I got incredibly lucky, or SPIGEN nailed the fit perfectly on these phones.3) DurabilityFinally, I can &#34;plop&#34; my phone on a table or accidently drop it anywhere without feeling worried. Seriously, I don't feel worried at all that my phone is going to be damaged within this case. I even test-dropped it 6 ft on the cement as soon as I got it (it was a little scary, but I did it) and nothing happened to the phone. I'm happy!4) (Bonus) GLAS.tRNow, the GLAS.tR is a separate product by SPIGEN, but it goes perfectly with this case. I'd highly recommend getting this product alongside with the Tough Armor case. I won't review the GLAS.tR here, but I will say that SPIGEN designed the Tough Armor case to fit with the GLAS.tR perfectly. My phone is 100% secured, front and back with the GLAS.tR and I have the case on as well.---UPDATE: 3 months of ownershipIt's been 3 months and it's going strong! I have dropped my phone numerous times and there are zero scuffs on the aluminum backplate and my phone looks great! I convinced my girlfriend to get one when she got her new 5S.I 100% recommend this case to anyone who doesn't need their case to be waterproof/dustproof and just needs something strong to protect their phone."

I constantly see people around town with cracked screens on their iPhone 4's and 5's which is likely because the glass is raised above the edge of the phone. This case securely creates a lip to cover the edges of the glass, and I love the extra cushioning that the corners have as dropping your phone on its corner is highly likely to crack the screen. The back of the case does show some scratch marks pretty quickly but the point of the case is that it isn't your phone suffering the scratches.

Looks terrific and gives a great fit, if you don't mind the sharp angles and edges.  You might need a bit of time to get comfortable holding the phone given the non-rounded sides, but you'll adapt quickly.  Only complaint might be that the back (mine is brushed silver) scratches very easily; knicks and small cuts already show up on the back of my case and I have been very delicate with the phone.  I can't imagine what a fall to the floor would do to the case.  But hey, that's what a protective case is supposed to do, right?  To take the hits and keep the phone safe and unmarked.

The view hole exposing the Apple logo is appreciated and adds to the sharp look of the case. The front of the case wraps all the way around the iPhones edges allowing full access to the 5s fingerprint reader. Inside the case is a soft rubber lining for absorbing shock and will not scratch the iPhone's metal back.

I was pulling out my phone from my pocket and I accidentally slip it. My phone falls right on to the hard rock ground. I was so worried but then i pick it up and started to see if it does any damage to it. My phone was still in perfect shape. The case itself does not even left a scratch. It is still the same before i drop it. I was very pleased.2) It is well designed. Unlike some other brand that claims to have a excellent protection which giving it a horrible buffy look. This case achieve the same goal of protecting it while keeping the slim, light design of a iPhone 5S. To me, it a perfect combination, which does not ruin the iPhone design. It feels like this would last very long.Cons:1) There is a hole on the back side that allows the logo of apple to be shown would contain dust after days of use. It does not affect the functionality but it makes it a bit unpleasant for me to clean it up. (I found that annoying because i hate dust) This happen to the same to the hole for camera, the side silent button and the bottom.2) The power button is much harder to press after using the case, it does not give the smooth feeling but i am use to it now. It's just something that people would notice right after using it. It might bother some people.I really want to give a 4.5 star but amazon won't let me so i am giving a 4 instead."

It adds a few centimeters on all sides and edges, but it still looks and feels streamlined. The soul black version looks great on the space grey 5s. The buttons remain responsive when covered by the case. The ONLY reason I took a star away was because my case came delivered with a small flaw. The hard smooth plastic on the middle back of the case does not sit flush with the top rubber part on the back where it connects to the mute slider on the side of the phone. This causes the case to not sit flat on any surfaces and I'm worried it could start to separate even more over time.

The rubber-like/plastic hybrid design actually bends in your hands a little too easily for my tastes and the fake rubber 'air cushin' or whatever they call it is about a 1/4 millimeter thick and not even soft. I don't really see how this is going to protect my phone if I drop it. Nothing like my Trident Aegis for my Samsung Galaxy which is made of silicone and polycarbonate. Oh, and the outer hard shell that 'looks' like metal or something, it's actually cheap feeling plastic that sucks fingerprints and probably scratches easily. Look, I can get something like this on Amazon for $5 and have done so already, but $35.00 for a piece of glass and an additional $8 for this? Please.

I had an Otterbox Commuter on my old iPhone 4S and compared to this case it was really think. I hope that the phone is as well protected as my old phone was in the OtterBox case.My only complaint with this case is that the Apple 30 pin to Lightning adapter does NOT fit the phone with this case on.

The picture shows this case being completely open on the bottom - it actually has two &#34;posts&#34; connecting the two bottom pieces which block the lightning connector from going all the way in.  Rather than mess up the case (I had success on a previous case but didn't want to mess this one up) I whittled the plastic away on the sides of the connector in the docking cradle.  It fits now with the case on it.  So if you are getting this to dock your phone, it probably won't work without altering either the case of the cradle.

Despite having seen videos of phones &#34;protected&#34; by this case get rolled over by cars...dropped from great heights...etc. (all of which were posted by the company, of course), I learned the hard way that this case does not protect an iPhone screen when said iPhone is dropped onto the ground of a parking garage.  This in and of itself is not so bad...I understand that these things happen.

Ive had all 5 generations of the phone since the 3Gs and used cases with all of them.I'm a wood worker and frequently covered in dust. This is the first case I've had that keeps almost all dust off the phone. All previous cases have leaked enough that removing the phones from the cases, there'd be dust and dirt all over the inside of the case and the phone. The Spigen Tough Armor only leaks a minuscule amount at the bottom. It has a perfect fit at the edge of the screen. It fits exactly to the edge of the glass, without lipping onto the glass, forming a very tight seal. That leaves me wide open to use whatever screen protection I choose.There are other case options that would perhaps help with my specific dust issues. I get that. I don't however, care to increase the bulk of my phone to the proportions and weight of a brick.This case provides a great combination of good protection, a very comfortable to pocket and hold size, and a decent price.I wish it didn't have the circular cut out to show the Apple logo on the back of the device. It's just another place to catch dust. I know it's an iPhone, I really don't care if anyone else does."

I like the look of it very much.  Color choices are excellent as well - I selected the Metal Slate for that blue-ish tint.What I don't like is if you happen to catch the lip of the metal back when you are sliding the mute switch into the silent mode, it can lift the metal back off the rest of the case so you either have to fiddle with it to reengage or remove it from the phone altogether to get it to lock into place.  It happened the first time I used it and I debated about returning it but it hasn't happened again since I pay more attention to the issue so I am keeping it.It could have just a smidge more 'grippy' to the sides but overall it is much better than the naked phone where I always felt it was going to slip out of my hand.

I will follow up again with them.My Spigen Satin Silver ToughArmor for my iPhone 5S showed up today. I purchased it instead of another Speck since my last Speck Clamshell fell apart.  I have mixed feelings after having it for less than a day. It seems solid which is why I purchased it, but it is rather uncomfortable to hold.  While the Speck was only plastic, it felt nice to hold.  This case feels almost sharp to touch, specifically on the left side where the rubber touches the metal.

SLIMCheck! It's a lot less bulkier than other iPhone cases.2. PROTECTIVE (-1 star)I have yet to drop my phone *knock on wood*; however, this phone doesn't seem to offer as much protection as I was used to with my Speck candyshell cases or all silicone cases. The biggest reason for this is that the 'ledge' that pops out from around the screen isn't too high. I searched many Spigen products and concluded that this one offered the most protection for the brand, with the highest 'ledge.' Still, I wish it was a bit higher. In addition, although I definitely appreciate clean lines, I wish the phone felt more comfortable in my hand. Its design is very sleek, but the very definied edges make it less comfortable to hold. Lastly, if the 'ledge' wasn't so...defined like this: /|  SCREEN  |\ (view when laid flat), i feel like it would be better suited for protection.3. NOT TOO UGLYI got the metal slate color to match the black/metal slate color of my iPhone5. It matches perfectly, and this was important to me because the Apple logo on the back of the phone would be showing through that hole in the back of the case. Not sure why that hole is there...I wish it wasn't, but oh well. I bought some studs from Etsy and studded it so it doesn't look so dull.Overall, its a good, no-frills case. Again, I have not dropped my phone yet. This is merely by looks; however, I tend to drop it a lot because I take on a lot more than I can hold with my hands...and my phone often takes the fall. I'm hoping this case stands up to it. If not...I'll be updating this review."

This Spigen case feels good in the hand and isn't nearly as bulky. While the Otterbox probably offered more protection due to it's multiple layers of materials and it's ultra tight construction of the inner snap on piece which included a screen protector covered by the rubber outer-shell, this Spigen case along with the Spigen GLAS.tR slim screen protector I added to the phone should be plenty of protection. Although the reviews i checked on this Spigen Tough Armor case did point out that it scratches easy on the back, I hope to be pretty careful about how I handle it, and avoid scratches. But I guess that's the purpose of a &#34;tough&#34; case, is to take a few scratches so that the phone itself doesn't. Good price for this case too. Cheers."

I wish it didn't have an opening over the rear Apple logo, but that is merely a personal preference, not a design flaw. I didn't take any real time to research this case before ordering it; AT&T fast-tracked my 5S (received it on Sept. 23!) so I needed a case immediately. Feel highly fortunate that this is the one I got.

I previously had a 4S and it was outfitted with the Ballistic extremely heavy duty case (like Otterbox), which was also quite bulky. I wanted something that offered comparable protection but not nearly as large and thick. This appears to be a good alternative. It is well constructed and engineered. The manufacturing is very precise. It feels like it is good and solid, not like the cheap rubbery ones or the really hard plastic ones. I think for most normal handling and occasional drops or bumps of the phone this should be just fine. It is a 2 piece case that has the black plastic part that will wrap around your phone, and then you &#34;snap&#34; on the anodized part that fits like a precision piece of machinery. My only gripe, and why I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5, is that the anodized finish is not a bit more durable. I have only had this case for a couple of weeks and I am very careful with my phone, often to the point of being obsessive. It is either in my pocket, or safely sitting on a clean table, my desk at work, or the non-slip gel pad in my car or someplace like that. Despite my careful handling of the case/phone, it already has a scratch on the back. I don't know where it came from, but I know I have not dropped it or anything, maybe just had my keys in my pocket with the phone or something, although I usually avoid that as well. I hope it doesn't continue to get scratched this easily as I am really happy with the look of it otherwise, as well as the feeling that my phone does have good protection."

The case does not add a significant amount of weight or bulk. I have not tested it's ability to protect my iPhone from a fall nor do I plan to. The case itself seems pretty durable. The shell is pretty hard so I do not expect pieces to crack off or the case to loosen over time. The case adds a bare minimum amount of friction so don't expect it to stay put on your car dashboard, but that also means you won't pull out your pocket lining with your phone.I gave 4 stars, because I have a bunch of stereo audio cables that are too wide to be plugged into the audio port of the phone with the case on. Most headphones shouldn't have a problem, but I hate having to take my phone out of the case to plug in speakers. My old Speck case on an iPhone 4 didn't have this problem."

The thin armor must be very thin.In comparison to my gf's otterbox it is soooo thin.Case came quickly. Screen protectors were way past due date. Both were professionally packaged.High quality materials. Great look and feel.My only complaint is the time frame on the screen protectors, and the fact I ordered over the amount from their company to get free shipping, and they decided to break up the order and charge shipping cost.So for those reasons, I leave partial negative feedback."

I was a little skeptical because its in the same category of protection as the Otterbox cases and those things are obese. Rest assure, this case is relatively thin. It is no where as thick as the defender. I would say that it is almost as think as the commuter but offers way more protection. I slap this case on the moment my phone came out of its box, and I cant stop admiring it. It is a great looking case. Very sleek and very low profile.I do have to put a disclaimer,the secondary color on the back does scratch rather easily. I bought the Metal Slate and kinda wish I purchased the black, but the color looks so nice. I have found myself not placing the phone face down whenever I remember so that I can prolong the scratches. I have had the phone for nearly a month now and have developed quite a bit of scratches.I would give 5 stars, but the scratching should be addressed."

Instead ill just put down the Pros and Cons and let YOU decide.Pros:1. Fits on Perfectly, No struggle, No loosen sides.2. Hard rubber, meet fancy plastic cover. Very nice and stylish touch to it.3. Keeps the phone secure, and not to thick. Only mm's longer.4. Doesn't trap the phone and keep it from ventilating. (Yes phones breath too Well they have to have air ventilate to prevent from overheating. You can suffocate your phone in a otterbox)5. Doesn't lift up and fold my screen protector that was already placed on my phone.Cons:1. The front doesn't offer very good drop protection. Very vulnerable in the front."
