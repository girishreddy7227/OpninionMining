One pros side, there's not much I can add to what's already been said. It is great and I'm glad I upgraded from an iPad 2 to iPad 4.But I'm deducting one star for the following reasons:Apple wants to upsell you from the iPad 2 to the iPad 4 mostly on this criteria:1) Siri. There's nothing revolutionary about it. For most it's answers it just spits out Google search results and then you do the rest. People are fascinated by it because it throws a few human-like colloquialisms.2) Retina display. I upgraded from an iPad 2. To quite frank, things do no all of a sudden jump out at you in iPad 4. Yes, I do like it. And it's very nice to be sure. But the Retina Display is just a name someone dreamed up that makes it sound more innovative than it actually us. High resolution is everywhere. It's just that Apple give it a snazzy name and suddenly, it's like the a new invention.3) 'A6 is 2x faster than A5' Huh? Reality check. This one is probably where I feel people are misled the most. To me the A5 is noticeably faster and that's nice. But in real life 'twice as fast' means 50 mpg vs 25 mph. Or flying from L.A. to Hong Kong in 8 hours instead of 16. To me the speed difference is more like flying from L.A. to Hong Kong in 14 hours instead of 16.All in all, there a lot of hype that used to make the iPad 4 sound like a quantum leap rather than the incremental improvement that it is. Thus we pay more for it.That said, I like it a lot, but mainly for the reasons that people have liked the iPad ever Steve Job unveiled on that big screen behind him...not because of these minor improvements."

I even set up 1 of laptops for dual os usage--- Linux and windows. I really loved Linux the bests but apps are hard to find. So,after nearly 35 yrs of computer usage,I feel I can objectively rate the apple iOS on my new ipad. I heard,read,and researched info. About apple and thought I should change over after conferring with my husband (senior software engineer) who said apple now has business apps for the professional population. That said: here I am after only one week of owning an iPad and I AM CONSIDERING getting rid of it, the main complaints about windows are: 1) windows 8 2) privacy, 3) the wga genuine harassment (paid a lot of money for msn windows 7 and EVEN with re-doing I'd numbers back and forth --- I constantly got a &#34;not genuine&#34; tag that constantly pops up no matter what I did--- I had been using the same os and upgraded to professional, and after a year, for some reason,it started popping up the WGA harassment!  4) during os scans,Microsoft data,,virus,identifying, LSO ,was the #1 culprit that were &#34;infecting&#34; my computer!  With these 4 windows os  ( there are FAR more) issues , I decided to leave that os. NOW The iPad issues : 1) apple support (for HOW to use this iPad--- not repairs or apps , all of which are general) I am being forced to give the serial number which I know to be a &#34;record&#34; of my personal computer. And NO I am NOT interested in a relationship with apple EVER. Don't I have the right to know how to use this expensive piece of ----- I hadn't even turned it on because I didn't want ios7 automatically downloading on my ipad! And the rep lied and said it wouldn't  and I have full control. Over it not happening. Well, it DID auto download without my permission! Even though it isn't installed, IT Is the manipulative,greedy, way that Apple is controlling over what I want to download . Now,I can't get rid of it,and this nagging update flag is in plain sight on my computer every time I turn it on, this control reeks of dictatorship without any regards to MYRight to use my computer! 2) I didn't buy this iPad for facebook or twitter or ANY social Media at all! Instead of going to the media website and installing it BY MY choice, it is everywhere ---- my settings, shows up in website address bar as I am typing which website I wANT to go to. And if my finger slips on it or I accidentally tap those sites, I get connected or it begins to install itself! This alone disgusts me no END! 3) all software downloads have to come through the apple store---how proprietorial is that! That , too, I didn't know. What I was told was that apple apps are virtually virus free without &#34;bug&#34;. So why can't I download the free open office word processor directly from the Internet? Another  dictatorial control of apple. (4) the web browser is awful! No way of setting privacy features such as third party cookies (instead there is an &#34;always&#34; , &#34;never&#34; or when I visit,to always accept all cookies. A site by site &#34;allowable cookie&#34; option is not available. And I can't even get redirects stopped when I do a first party website connection,  No add ons, and I have to remember every time I leave the site or shut down, to have all browser history deleted and cookie deletion. Safari is the ONLY web browser because all other browsers have to go through apple's  exclusive browser and it slows down Internet service. (5) email is not user friendly. It is difficult to have all email sites linked to this feature. In fact, using emails other than gmail,yahoo is almost impossible. I don,t use them at all. (6) having to constantly use a password each and every time I access they apple stop is time consuming and the iPad doesn't allow me to have it automatically saved.Well there's the review.like I said ,i am considering getting rid of my ipad. In fact, I am trying to find a reason (s) to keep it. If I get rid of iPad--- I will use Linux only--- it is extremely popular in  Europe"

This used to be a pretty good companion to life but with IOS-7 I'm thinking about smashing it with a hammer.  I really was going to upgrade to an IPad with larger internal storage but have SERIOSLY changed my mind.  I have been an IPad user since the first generation.  This retina display 64 is my 4th IPad and the pad itself is great but the operating system is now AWFUL.The keyboard is frustrating with many quirks.  He functions operate at a much slower speed, the battery life is greatly diminished, with the new calendar app you may as well just use an old paper day timer.  Safari takes longer to load up internet pages....and much more.  The new upgrade is a farce and I will not buy another iPhone (on my 5th) or iPad again.  Once these are gone, I will not replace them.  My suggestion would be to learn another operating system.  Androids are cheaper, and I've found my Kindle to be a new companion and easier to use since IOS-7.  The system used to be very user friendly and actually kinda classy looking, but now it's design takes after  operating in an old Windows computer in SAFE mode 24-7.  And who wants that. It is absolutely NOT visually stimulating at all.  We went from a classy Cadillac Made In the USA look to a cheap Chinese knockoff.  Again, buy something else....

By the fourth, it seems comparatively lackluster. That isn't to say that the product is bad, or worse than its predecessor, but having owned the 1st, 3rd, and now 4th generation Ipad, here are my thoughts.-- The processor speed and performance is much improved. This is noticeable during use, and the only reason to get the latest version.-- The Retina Display is nice, but personally I wasn't as impressed with it as I hoped to be. Likely because fonts and such are all still the same size. For photographers, the increased resolution will result in extra sharpness, but for most users it won't make a bit of difference.-- The latest iPad really hasn't added much; it's competitors have been adding innovative designs and features since it came out. Apple needs to come up with a creative twist on the iPad that makes the cost difference worth the purchase.Bottom Line: I have bought iPads for work use, to test products and features we develop. They are a nice, simple product. If I was making a personal buying decision, I'd go with a competitor for what I perceive to be a significant difference in price/capability."

Apple has the most apps available and most android apps have an Apple counterpart so you sure can't go wrong there.  My only complaints are not so much on the Ipad but the philosophy behind it, NO easy expansion options.  There are ways to take more movies and music with you using a mobile wifi external USB or card reader such as the EasyACC device but it is more cumbersome than just sliding in a card as I can do with the Acer.  Tablets are a product that many of use are now heavily reliant on. I travel a lot and a laptop was always kind of a pain to lug around.

It has taken some time and will take more to learn the functionality but so no issues.

Safari is an wasting Internet browser to use and, while you can't customize settings as much as a laptop computer, it has excellent malware protection and is set up very conveniently for the casual browser. It's a good weight too. While shopping for my tablet, I've looked at and held many other brands. A common problem (for me) is that a lot of them felt too light for their size. This is probably because apple uses aluminum for the back cover of their tablet instead of plastic. It feels sturdy, and that's a good thing when it comes to durability. Another excellent apple quality? The apps! I know, other tablets have apps too, but apple has kind of cornered the market on app production. Most of what you can find on an android or kindle tablet, you can find in the apple store (and then some). See an app not available through apple? Probably a good thing! I've learned that Apple screens all of their apps before putting it up in the store. This means that there are no major malware problems. There are some disadvantages of course: 1- you have to buy directly from apple as they do have monopoly on their stuff and a lot of imitation items are suspect (this can get pricey), 2- you can't really open two screens the way you can simultaneously on other devices. This is not to say that you can't have two (or more) things running at once, but you have to switch entirely between them and can't view both on the screen at once. 3- there are many conveniently pre-downloaded onto other tablets that are very useful for students and office work. You can get a lot of those same apps through the apple store, but many of the better ones are not free and you have to pick and choose your way through quite a few applications.There are probably more then 3, but these are the ones that stood out to me. Overall though, PROs totally outweigh the CONs, making this tablet just plain awesome! (So awesome that my best friend saved started saving up for one right after mine came in the mail.)"

However, that's no longer true, at least when comparing iPad 4 to my HTC One. iPad 4 is just as smooth as HTC One, and is still laggy sometimes (For example the frame rate of some animation drops significantly). The screen is a bit yellow, and its overall performance is on a par with HTC One. iPad 4's hardware technically is faster, but no any difference is found on system speed so far. Therefore, iPad has no advantage over HTC One, except the much bigger screen.On the other hand, Android is of course MUCH freer and easier to use. The iOS and iTunes always takes me hours to do something that can just be done in three minutes on Android. (Copying pictures from iPad that was not taken as photos, etc)I was SHOCKED when I found I cannot install an IME or a system tool, cannot customize the system UI or configuration, and even cannot copy files from others' computer without logging into iTunes! These are untolerable. Jailbreak solves some of them, but no jailbreak is available for iPad 4 over 6.13 so far.iPad 4 is just a toy for those who don't want to manage it, but only use it."

But even though the Amazon Market Place's packaging for shipment was as good as required for shipping and delivering this type of merchandise, and that the Apple iPad factory box was undamaged, both wrappings intact and unopened, the iPad screen came with a noticeable two centimeter hairline scratch on top center, right below the camera lens. The scratch was visible through the factory envelope-like cellophane wrapping around the iPad itself. That type of scratch, could not had happened at the seller's warehouses, nor during transportation/delivery because it requires direct contact with the screen to produce it and as I explained the delivery package and product box where undamaged and unopened, so responsibility lies with manufacturing facility during or before final boxing of the iPad, which says a little of quality assurance and control in this case. That is, I do not blame Amazon nor the seller for the problem in this particular case (first time ever).That aside, the new iPad is working nicely and has a great retina display (colors, graphics, resolution...) and great speed. But I still will not give it the fourth and fifth stars, because contrary to what I'm used, and expect, to get from Apple products, this one didn't have that mint condition look that I expected from and Apple's new item. Instead of going trough the process of returning with all the time delay and implications (customs in my country for once)I installed a anti-glare/mate screen protector to 'hide' the scratch, which somehow defeats the purpose of the great retina displayIMPORTANT UPDATE: IOS 7 have a feature that cannot be turned of, which verifies that the Lightning connector is certified by Apple, and as soon as I update to IOS 7, and connected my iPad to be charged with the Lightning connector that came with the iPad in the original, brand new, sealed and unopened factory box I got a pop up display that stated that my iPad connector isn't certified and my not function properly with my iPad. I reported this to apple via chat support and the agent told me, after running an online diagnostic, that my device and connectors were new and that it was a glitch in the IOS 7 verifying routine that would be fixed on a next release (update of IOS 7), so I dismissed (every time) the message and charged my iPad without problems. But that was until today, after connecting the new iPad with the supposedly original Apple lightning connector and receiving the  warning message, the iPad stop charging after reaching 27% charge. Beware, either don't buy this model or wait until Apple issues some kind of correction or update removing that verifying routine from IOS 7. Right now for me, living outside the US this is a disaster, returning the device, for me is not an option. So I will have to take my iPad to a Venezuelan authorized service center, testing and probably buying a new 'original' lightning connector, cause if I buy the Apple care plan in the US It won't be applicable in my country."

Desktop Windows 8 and Linux servers.If you would have told me that I would own an iPad, I would have laughed, but I got it as a gift, so I'm definitly enjoying this, but first a few things.1) White sucks. Get black, pictures and video pops better.2) Don't just get a Smart Cover, get a smart case, so the back is protected.3) don't download a billion apps and if you enjoy a free app then buy the paid version. (it's only fair)As for the iPad itself.As I said, white wasn't the best choice, but it's still pretty cool. VERY heavy compared to Galaxy, but also feels much better built. The glass is smooth and slippery so it's easy to swipe around. The apps are the same, the only exception being that on Android, I could use 1Password for free and on the iPad they want 16 bucks. Needless to say I will no longer be purchasing from Agile Bits.The rest of the review.Meh.It's a tablet. You don't really need it, but it's cool to have.Oh yeah, it is a finger print magnet and do not use after eating Cheetos."

Truly the iPhone is a great product, but after having owned and fiddled with the iPad for a spell, I must readjust my favoritism and focus it on this marvelous device.I'm not a gamer, nor am I a person who is likely to have a need or use for high-end software; my iPad is very humbly stocked with a few books and some google-related applications. For my needs, the device works like a dream. There's no returning to a laptop when it comes to sitting on the sofa and surfing the web -- the iPad is it!For all those who are uncertain as to whether this device is right for you, my two cents are to go for it. Most users have had an experience comparable to my own and we can't *all* be wrong.Cheers,-Nick"

Of course it depends on the user and most people who come in the store weren't technologically savvy. So, the majority of people wanted something easy to pick up and learn. Therefore, the majority of my recomendations were the iPad. I am in college and I have an internship. Both of these roles I use the iPad in. I am even using my iPad right now. I have a Macintosh computer and I found myself using my iPad for the majority of my computing needs. The iPad has also paid itself off by the cost of Text Books alone. Every book I get on my iPad saves me on average about $100. E text books are much cheaper than buying books on campus. I also have a keyboard case which they sell on Amazon for less $50.00. I use an app called Pages, which is an Apple developed app, that allows me to edit, import and export Word Documents. Not to mention its movie and music capabilities. I also invest heavily and the iPad has made my life so much easier when it comes to managing my investments and banking. Overall, the iPad has been a life saver for me and my family.

This acts as my kindle, laptop, notebook, scheduler, and email service all in one.It's not perfect, trying to transfer documents and such is a little cumbersom and requres you get the right apps, but with a little bit of tweaking you can customize it to your needs. Be awair that unlike your Ipod, or a USB drive this will not show up on your my Computer (if you have Windows) and you have to go through Itunes (not a real problem) to transfer most files.

They look for all these expensive items, and never use all its potential. An iPad is a real powerful tool. You can automate tasks, help you organize yourself, save on text messages, calls, learn through downloadble apps, etc. All this in a single item. If you're looking for a tablet to just surf the internet, listen to music, facebook, just buy something else. The power and potential of the iPad doesn't deserve to be on standby forever."

The Samsung I felt was a good tablet.  I won't say I was anti Apple but I was trying to justify my reasons for buying the Samsung.  I got tired of hearing how good Apple is....how clear the picture is compared to Samsung etc.  so, I purchased an Apple I-pad.  I figured I still have my Samsung.  If I don't like the Apple I will return it and get my money back.After using my Apple for a few weeks now, I am totally sold on this product!  If fact I am considering a total change to Apple for all of my computer needs!  Next it will be a switch from my Dell desktop to the Apple 27 inch desktop.  I have been a Dell customer for approximately 20 years!Apple is a more expensive way to go, but I feel it is the best way for me.  I think Apple products are very much worth the price difference..in my opinion!Why have I strayed somewhat away from the review of the Apple I-pad!  I wanted to express my feelings about a company that I could care less about that changed because of 1 of their products....the Apple iPad with the Retina Display MD511 LL/A (32 GB, Wi -Fi, Black).

It really doesn't do that much more than the iphone except the display is amazing, it takes really really nice pictures, and the sound is much better than an iphone. You really don't need extra speakers unless you are using it to listen to music and have a larger living space.I bought it because I work online and thought it would be nice and compact to work from but better than my iphone. I NEVER work on it. I mean I can check email and all of that but it's just not a laptop. I should have passed on this and gotten one of the thin little laptops instead.Also if you get one, get some kind of warranty and get a cover for it before it even arrives. It's more fragile than the iphone. I did not have a cover on my iphone when I first got it and dropped it a few times and it was fine. I was in the process of looking for a cover for this ipad and dropped it and the screen cracked. It's going to cost me at least $160 to get a new screen. The more protected it is the more places you will take it and the more use you will get out of it. I was at disney world's magic kingdom a few weeks ago and they have this amazing electric show at night. It looked like an ipad commercial. Everyone was holding up their ipads and recording it. But again I would be hesitant to haul it around without sufficient protection.So the graphics are amazing and it's a fun little gadget to watch movies or play games with.Oh I'm also in a few bible studies and the bible app is WAY better than on the iphone and you can also download books on kindle app. I do this with my bible study workbooks and you can fill it the blanks and answer questions and everything. The youtube app looks good.I'm not sure what else to say other than everything works and it's not defective. I just don't have a lot of money for &#34;toys&#34; so I wish I had gone with the laptop."

Second I did not buy this product from Amazon because of two reasons, 1. At the time when I was ready to purchase the 128gb cellular version it was going for a 1000 dollars plus on this website, when apple stores and bestbuy stores were selling this for $929 plus tax. 2. Some of the reviews suggested the seller was actually sending people used iPads when paying clearly buying 'new' products.Anyways, I love it, its fast, easy to use. You get what you basically put into it, the app store is amazing with so many things that make this ipad great. I can not believe I did not own one sooner.The only thing I can not figure out how to do is, is be able to send multiple attachments within a email. I hope some new application or apple fixes this issue. Its easy to do one at a time, but its not efficient. It seems like a common problem and question that is asked i noticed when googling this issue.My iPad has had none of the issues addressed earlier. It gets great wifi signal all the time and the 3G works great also. I am glad I got this instead of a Android based Tablet."

We all know the iPad is the touch screen equivalent of the gold medal - others have come & gone, but it's still what every other tablet is compared to. Regarding this model, the only major difference between the 4th generation & the 3rd is a more powerful processor, but the amazing Retina screen remains the same - & as someone with a 2013 Macbook Air too which doesn't have a Retina display, the Retina screen is quite a difference.  I use my MA more for computing, while the iPad (to me) is more of an entertainment device - & its screen is definitely perfect for it.  Pixelation is all but a thing of the past with this baby!  Overall, I use this for Netflix & YouTube (& occasionally checking email, Facebook, etc.), but really, for a tablet & everything that goes with that, the iPad is everything you could ask for."

And I will also say that as a smart phone user, I will likely never leave the Android market.When it comes to tablets though, Apple has this race won by a long shot. Most people against Apple products complain about not having widgets, or about being 'stuck into one persons way of thinking' with Apple's designs. Not having the customization options and whatnot.I was originally the same way, first purchasing the Nook HD+, and then exchanging it for the Galaxy Tab 2 10.1 Inch. Both of these do not stand up to the iPad.The processor in this new iPad is SO fast, the games that would use that processing speed have not even been built yet. The screen resolution looks more amazing than some games on my 1080P screen when playing X360.This device has changed the way I work, and the way I live. I have a mobile hotspot on my phone now, so I have this powerful device ready to go anywhere I go. Processing my workload is a breeze since my workstation now goes with me in my bag.What is also great is that SO many apps link between both iOS and Android. So I can update a spreadsheet on my iPad, and review it later from my phone if needed. Skype is also wonderful, which has allowed me to connect with my father in ways that have not been possible for years due to the distance between us.There is no memory slot, so I purchased the 32GB. I do not download music or movies, so the space is only for apps, photos, etc.I am a heavy Netflix and Amazon Prime user, so I watch shows on this every day. There are also TONS of free games with incredible graphics for you to enjoy.All in all, this is easily one of the most profitable purchases and investments that I have ever made. I am now a huge Apple fan and I am extremely excited to watch their products develop.If you have ever considered going Apple, but thought against it because you are an Android lover, stop right here. Just make the purchase, and try it out for a week or so. If you hate it, return it, but I do not see that happening. This is my most recommended product to all friends and family that are interested in advanced progressive technology, or who want a simple and powerful device to use instead of a bulkier, slower, and less convenient computer/laptop."

When charging, the touch screen was behaving in a very strange way. I cannot click on the icon and screen just acted very strange. It works fine when NOT charging. I brought to Apple Store since it has 90 days warranty and the staff confirmed that my iPad 4 came with a fake and faulty charger. The text on the charger also indicated 10watts and not the original 12watts. The iPad came in an original packing with USB cable but the wall charger was totally fake. I can feel the different in the material too.2. This was another disappointment for iPad4, it is thicker with bigger battery but it take like 4-5 hours for full charge from 50%. Also, when you use it for very long, the ipad get warm. I tried with different wall chargers (original 12W) and it is the same. The charging seem to take longer than the iPad2.I would stay away from iPad 4 is you are thinking of buying it for retina display.UPDATES: Contacted Amazon and the Seller. They suggested that I return the iPad4. I confirmed with Apple that iPad4 is ok and the charger need replacement. After several email exchanges, Amazon refunded me $19 so I can purchase original wall charger with 12 Watts for my iPad4. Kudos Amazon so I am giving the additional star for great customer service but not the product. Hopefully it charges faster now with 12W."

This was our 3rd iOS device and was my children's iPad.  Basically from day 1 they loaded up the iPad with apps of all sort, so much so that there was not enough space to get updates.  They have periodically come to me to complain about lack of wifi connectivity, I usually restarted the device and most of the time it would connect (for a time at least).  I assumed this was some sort of a software issue that would be corrected when I upgraded.  So I finally wiped off the iPad and upgraded and have only had a greyed out  wifi on switch.  We live in the great midwest nowhere close to an apple store.  I finally made a trip to Des Moines IA to take to the apple store there for service.  It is a wifi ant problem (a known issue) and the fix involved $300 to upgrade.  It is certainly my fault for not believing my kids or investigating the issue sooner.  The apple store is so well advertised as the place to go to get apple products fixed I wrongly assumed this was my only option.If this were any other sort of problem (bluetooth issue, cracked screen etc) I would expect that to be a reasonable option for an out of warranty issue - but with a known problem?  Microsoft generated so much goodwill by fixing their known hardware issue no matter when purchased, why can' apple at least match the customer service of MSFT?  I am just asking for my kid's ipad to be fixed so they can continue to use and purchase apps.Don't make me call the tech guy to complain - THIS IS A KNOWN ISSUE, I am just asking for Apple to take their billions of dollars and not stick it to a Dad trying to get his kids an iPad - does that seem unreasonable?Jason Demuthjasondemuth@hotmail.com"

It is the first apple product to hit our home since the iphone 3 failure we had a few years back. So we got the ipad last night and proceeded to set it up. Everything was fine until we tried to use it. The first app we used caused the ipad to restart. So we tried again. Again 1 min into use and it restarted again. We thought, oh, maybe this thing cant download apps and use them at the same time. If that were the case I would return it for sure and not buy another because that is just ridiculous. Luckily that was not the case. The third time we tried an app we had nothing downloading, updating or anything, and it restarted again. I went to apples site to try to talk to someone about it and when I entered the serial number the site said it was out of warranty and no tech support could be used. That told me that there was an error or I was just sold a used ipad. Since amazon doesn't print the serial numbers on the receipt there is no was for me to prove I bought the ipad that same day. I then spoke to amazon about this and they said since I bought it thru a marketplace person we couldn't exchange it but had to return and buy it over. I thought fine...I will go and do that. Well, while I was on the phone the ipad timed out and went to sleep, but it wouldn't wake back up. So I called apple this morning and spoke to them about it. They told me it is possible the item was used before but there is no way for them to find out. They had me do a hard restart which made it possible for the ipad to turn on again but about 5 min after I hung up with the guy it turned off again and wouldn't turn back on. So I made my mind up. I hard restarted the thing, wiped it clean, and will mail it back Monday. Meanwhile, later today I will go to the apple store and buy one from them, brand new, with warranty. I figure this is apples 2nd strike against me. The only 2 apple items I have own were both defective, so either I have the worst possible luck or apple has fairly low quality standards. If I get a third defective product from them its over.Lesson here....check the serial number on apples site as soon as you get your item."

I will warn you that you do not want the screen to be as bright as it can be, because your battery will drain quickly.

I think that they use proprietary features and lock out very helpful items (like expansion cards and user-changeable batteries).  In fact, the biggest reason that Apple Fanboys tout their products is that they are user-friendly - and I find that ridiculous - iTunes is one of the WORST software interfaces I've ever seen - it's incredibly difficult to get it to do what you want.  And I've never been a fan of the iDevices either.Until today.  My incredibly generous girlfriend got me an iPad for my Birthday, and I am truly blown away by its ease of use (for the most part - some settings are really buried, or in non-intuitive locations), its tight form factor, its unbelievable battery life, and it's unparalleled apps and games.After only a few weeks, I find that it is my go to device for checking email, social media, gaming, and gathering information.  Even writing documents is easy because of Siri and it's impressive voice recognition.I still wish it had an SD card or expansion slot, but I really can't complain too much.

So I was apprehensive until the tab arrived. The tab came in unopened original packaging, arriving on time and in good condition. I own two iPad 1s and an iPAD 2, and now this iPAD with retina display. They all work just the way they should. The screen is a nice improvement. This iPAD is so thin that it is easy to misplace if you don't have it in a more bulky case (which I have now done).

I've owned each of the iPads (1, 2, 3, & mini) and just received this one.  It is very obviously faster than iPad 3!  I cannot believe the number of 'professional' reviewers on tech sites stating that they didn't really notice any difference.I was enraptured when I first obtained iPad 3, and felt at the time that the retina display ticked off my last 'needs' box as far as tablet computing.  But as I lived with it, it became annoying waiting on its A5X to scroll in a dense webpage ----- daily so.  And the internet browsing experience is the real reason to consider upgrading to the 4 from the 3; it really is that much better.  To use one of my favorite iDevice information websites as an example, go to www.imore.com on the iPad 3, and observe the staccato, stop-and-go browsing experience as you navigate down the page.  Now, do the same on the iPad 4; it's smooth as silk.I'll still be looking for the retina iPad mini when it arrives (looks like 2014 at this rate), but other than the slight heaviness of this iPad 4, I'm completely satisfied.  Noting the never-ending march to smaller-thinner-and-lighter-yet-longer-battery-life, it's difficult to see what Apple can do to improve upon this one."

That said, it's not without some flaws and annoyances. Foremost, there's no consistent method to back navigate. Perhaps, this was one of those cases where design overrules function; in order to keep the device looking elegant they sacrificed functionality. The result is confusion and inconsistency. In some cases you find yourself navigating back via the app itself; however sometimes you need to use the home function or start swiping. For example, at one point I opened a PDF that was attached to an email but then I could not easily find a way to close the PDF to return to the inbox. There's no consistency as to where the back function is to be found or what it may be called. Often you are forced to make reaches across the screen whereas if there was one consistent placement for a back function you always know where it is. The same is true for getting a list of apps running in the background. You are forced to use a awkward four finger up motion.  Why not just give us a consistent button for a list of running apps?  I found the need to use 4 finger swipes annoying.. Another missing function is the cancel key. If you accidentally start to download a huge file and want to abort - where's the key to stop the download?  The app store is annoying as you can't search for apps in ways of your choosing. Why not offer advanced search that would give you some options to sort and filter?  Another issue I have with the device is its dependence on iTunes. Certain files cannot be removed from the device unless you are on iTunes, really? Why? I should be able to delete files off my device. I'm assuming there's an app for doing that but really - why not just make that part of the OS? Speaking of what's not included - why not include a free calculator? Do I really need to shop for a basic calculator? The native Maps app is a work in progress with many roads or local features not labeled correctly. If you want to hook this device to a camera you need to purchase a special adapter but check the reviews for the adapter as many users are reporting it no longer works after the latest OS update. There's no easy way to manage your cookies in safari. In advanced setting you can either delete all cookie data or none.  It has a very nice display however I refuse to adopt Apple marketing speak and call it 'retina' display. Don't bother thinking you'll be able to send anything to your printer unless of course you have a specific 'air' printer that will work with the Apple iOS. I could go on but hopefully you get the point that this device has both strong and weak points."

I was a little worried about switching to the 16gb because of less space, but it turns out to be plenty of space since I stream my music (from google player and other services) instead of saving it directly on the device.I use the device primarily for reading, surfing the web, watching videos, and editing pictures and documents. However, since I have started using the new iPad, I use it more than my computer, and for many, many more projects. I've started listing items on eBay right from the device (which works even easier than on the computer, since it has the built-in camera). I also have been using it for many projects that require a lot of typing, as the smart case I purchased makes typing comfortable and easy. I've even started playing more games on it because of the incredible processor inside! Previously, I could only run Angry Birds and Diner Dash, as I knew they wouldn't crash (and heavier games like Infinity Blade crashed the old iPad way too often). Now I can run GTA Vice City while multitasking with eBay and email, and no lag at all!Apple has really outdone itself with this new iPad -- of course, I understand that it isn't worth the plunge if you own an iPad 3. However, if you are like I was--still using the old iPad (or no iPad at all)--this is more than worth the money! Do yourself a favor and get this device!"

It's like the Toyota and Honda cars from the 80-90s, the engine keeps running even if the frames falls off.In daily usage of over a year, I don't have a SINGLE major complaint about this product which is pretty amazing seeing as I try to find at least one thing to not give a product 5/5... I could nitpick on some minor things but this tablet is really that good (my macbook pro for example has a poorly designed graphics card that overheats all the time and makes me hate the product...) but this tablet, I would give it 10 stars if I could.Battery lasts forever, touch screen is the most accurate I have ever used, screen resolution is ridiculous (not just on paper, physically look and compare with competition), OS does not crash and the damage done by an app is contained to its process (very similar to QNX), plethora of apps including Google Chrome, Skype works great (anyone who has used Skype on Android knows what I'm talking about), and the list goes on and on...The only improvement I can think of is the weight and an affordable cover case for the tablet. Apple will never open up their OS which is basically why I keep at least one Android product with me to stay out of the distortion field ... but man that distortion field is bliss :)"

I bought the ipad 4 because of the price drops when the air was announced. I think we all can recognize that the Ipad as well as most tablets wont replace laptops and won't replace the PC or Mac for work. I use my ipad for entertainment and web and email and photos. The retina display is no big deal and actually makes photos look worse. I found many references to this in other reviews, but really did not believe for myself until I compared side by side with ipad 2. Mostly photos taken with camera phones of loer pixels look horrible on ipad 4 but good or even great on ipad 2. I am not impressed with the increased processor speed, as you really would not notice it anyway unless you play video games. I do not. Overall, there is really no discernible benefit to spend the money and replace an ipad 2. Of course if you did not own an ipad before, or owned the original, I highly recommend ipad over other tablets. I have owned and used many android based, and the Apple iOS I find better and much more stable. I give three stars solely based on the fact I don't see significant improvement between ipad 2 and 4 and the retina display is not a big deal,for web, email and apps. I might have been better to wait till my ipad 2 died and purchased the air ."

You are sucked into buying a new brand adapter, if you forget the brand power adapter at home on a trip.Unlike the other brand tablets, you can not recharge the Ipad with a universal cigarette power adapter from your car or with a universal usb micro cable connected to your laptop.As it is the tablet is already costly enough, why make more money from users if they forget their power adapter?Recommend for surfing the web or using game apps.Not the best for online video streaming.

Just like my relationship with my smartphone, don't leave home without it.  Crystal clear on graphics.  Of course, this is my first ipad so I cannot really compare it on past experience.  Tons of apps, batteries lasts ok.  100% can last for about a day (I actually used it for about an hour every hour, and by about 9-930 pm, battery was at 15%.  Again, depending on what you are doing, it lasted me for about 2 more hours (I think).Price was great!  Seller was AWESOME (they actually gave me a cover for this ipad as a token of appreciation for the business).  However, with that being said, if you have kids that always run around, MAKE SURE TO INVEST on a more &#34;military&#34; style case.  If you call Apple, the only thing that they could suggest was..., well sir, just buy a new one??!?  (yeah, like I have $500 bucks, spewing out from my pockets.  My response; okay let me go to my money tree and pick some bills out, goodbye!  If you go to an electronics store, make sure to have at least $200 laying around.  I broke/cracked my screen after 2 weeks!  So needless to say, a case with something covering the actual screen, yes it is a must!  No flash, no usb port, but takes good pictures and speakers are good as well.Item was shipped fast, very fast!  Definitely ordering from this person again!"

I thought there was no way that they can make the display any better... but I was wrong, it looks better than any still photo! It looks more real, realer. It is absolutely amazing. I got the 16GB Wifi only and have not had a problem with it once. I did get this one since I was not interested in the iPad Air that they had coming out, and I already had a 7 inch Kindle, so I was not interested in the iPad mini that was already on sale.I do not regret this purchase at all, everything on it works wonderfully, I got a Fintie case for it that rotates which is wonderful, and I must say that this iPad is the only thing in the world that is as close to perfect as anything or anyone can get. Pictures look wonderful, games look fantastic, and The Cloud works very well on this device. There is no set up time, just enter your email and password (or make an account) and that is it you are ready to use/share on The Cloud.I have to say now after experiencing Apple and their products, I now will be purchasing all their products (the products that I need) so they can all work together and accommodate one another. Right now I have an iMac and iPad and they work wonderfully together. Syncing my PC takes a bit more time, but it does indeed work. Although it is not as quick or seamless as my Apple products syncing with each other, but of course they are using the same iOS, etc. so that is understandable.This device is a masterpiece, best little computer there is, and is a absolute pleasure to have.5 stars all the way!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!"

Do not try others.","Since other people have written about the specifications and some of the advantages of the iPad tablet which I will not repeat here.  I will only say that  indeed the iPad works very well and you will be pleased with it.  I will also briefly tell you my own story to try another  tablet that left me completely unsatisfied and very disappointed: Before trying the IPad with Retina Display, I tried the most recent version of Amazon's tablet, the Kindle Fire HD 8.9' 4G LTE Wireless with 64G.The most powerful aspect of a tablet (according to my opinion) is its ability to establish a wireless connection. Without it, it is just a useless piece of extra weight someone carries around. And, unfortunately for Amazon, the Kindle's wireless card is not working as it should be.  In my home, the tablet was loosing connection with the router continually (even when I was keeping them within 1-2 feet from each other) for unknown reasons. When the connection was on, I opened some simple web pages but the downloading was very slow. Trying to open cnn.com, the downloading was so excruciatingly slow that the tablet went to sleep on its own.... And this happened multiple times, not once.  When I took it to an area where, in order to use the net, you must accept the terms and conditions, the connection was made but the browser got confused. The connection was lost and my efforts to reestablish it got fruitless. Although I use computers and other electronic devices on a daily basis and encountering problems is not foreign to me, with the Kindle I got tired and discouraged very quickly and I returned the tablet to Amazon  30 hours after I received it. The experience with the iPad has been completely the opposite. It worked immediately. The connections are relatively fast (often restricted by the lines themselves).  There is a tremendous number of apps and work well although some of the free ones are quite annoying since they broadcast so many ads that make their use very irritating. (Incidentally: At the time I am writing this review, Amazon's app for streaming video is not working on the iPad with retina display although it was working for the previous iPad models. One cannot login to his/her prime membership!)Overall, if you are thinking to buy a tablet, I would strongly recommend to buy  an iPad. However, think well before you decide. Amazon is great in returns (and  I am a very satisfied Prime customer); it will refund your money if you do not like the Kindle. However, Apple has a restocking fee (15% at least; may even vary from store to store); hence you may loose a considerable amount of money if you decide to return the iPad."

At first, I wasn't sure if it would be useful at all; rather, I thought it might be a distraction from my studying. After about two months in school, I absolutely LOVE this thing! The iPad is extremely useful and portable for studying anywhere, anytime.  It offers several different apps that allow you to store PDF documents, highlight, and annotate.A helpful tip for people interested in using this for school.  I subscribed for a free membership at Acrobat.com -- an Adobe product. This was a 100% free program.  You download the Acrobat app to your iPad, and it will allow you to view, highlight, and annotate.  The beauty of Acrobat is that they give you 5GB of free online storage.  (5GB is almost unheard of to get for free... Drop Box only offers 2GB for free.)  Once you have your Acrobat.com account set up, log on to the website from your desktop/laptop (wherever you have your PDF documents stored).  From there, you upload your PDFs to Acrobat.com, and you can access them anywhere and anytime by logging on to the website.  Your website login info will be saved in the Acrobat app on your iPad, and you can study and annotate your PDFs from there.  Once you are done studying, Acrobat automatically saves your modifications to those PDFs, so you can view your latest modified document ANYWHERE.  If you forget your iPad one day, you can log in on any computer and view/modify your documents from Acrobat.com.  **By using Acrobat.com you will not use up any of your iPads hard drive space, so the 16GB was more than enough for me.^^ Sorry about that tangent, but I found this extremely helpful, and I wanted to share it with everyone!  Overall, I am extremely happy with the iPad.  It is EXTREMELY user friendly.  It is also versatile and can be used for almost any purpose.  Definitely consider the iPad if you are looking to use it for games, study, internet browsing, etc..."
